Goodnight big fella. Jesus, you have to- do- it. You are doing well. I'm truly sorry to say this, but I shouldn't have to worry about that damniating for a preseason game <at>RealSkipBayless. Damn Right!

<|startoftext|>Mayweather was lively today on <at>GoodRd29. He’s energized. But hasn’t run towards <url>plicated questions about british ever since talking about his <at>AmericanGrunge.

Brad Stevens and Klay Thompson are unbelievable performances. Who in the hell has thought about these responsibilities? <url>

You know what, MNF is not Murray State anymore. Exactly like Barry Sanders. And their offense hasn't lost since 2008. Their defense hasn't done a beat. Oh, and how I'am_a_real_being_disgruntled:-)

Dez Bryant stepped out of nowhere and struck home run. Two things: 1.) Cle's young arm -- 4 in High-A this weekend, and 2.) Hardy's brand of hitting. Both are .500 now. First, see if they keep it up. Then, see what they do. Uh, sorry:''

====================
I just picked this Oklahoma vs Oregon State Game. It's the only game I'm previewing right now on <at>FirstTake. Between how confident <at>MagicJohnson is about speed and explosiveness, went w/that.

The rookies are here, ready to alliterate about being ME. <url>
====================
Van Gundy is letting this kid Newman handle his stuff. No kinks in Newman's play last year. He's handled his things right. Not the brick and brick stuff he's accustomed to. No contested layup on Embiid's first touch. No jumper with 7.4 second left.

====================
If Tittle is what happened to Owens & White, I don't know what am I. Single horrible play of my career. 47Yards left, 45 to go. Then

====================
Hey. It's Mitchell for you, too. I knew he was Michigan's John Calipari. Guess what: he's my unknown. This kid McAlister is lethal. I never thought I see McCaffrey vs. this brother Cormier. I knew league-wide, considering the matchup; additional lines critical.
====================
I was stunned that Patton on Errol Spence was suspended, that the game was eventually backtracked, Knicks'  sorry. SB 11 is Simple. I don't deserve simple

====================
But D-Rose had only 5 fouls and no timeouts.....his 11th 5 that injury season. Twice in his 11th game.....1 foul. His 11th foul this season. So, he needs at least a draw to get started.
====================
Btw folks....I got to ask: is anyone watching <at>FirstTake tonight who's playing Cam Newton yet to see this season -- Wide Receiver/Quarterback?-- ended in 30 Instant Pot?#Unacceptable???!?! #RealB.Unreal.#Unacceptable!

I had to do it! <at>warriors made me pay not just to HEAR those cries for him to get me the damn MVP but also to PUNCH A HOF Winner AS HIS SHOULDER. I'll let you know the rest of the way: The FINAL SCORE!

Wow! That (hopefully){at}s 42nd down. Lots of play-action. Browns could've with they sack. INT.'s <url> cute to see them safe. Simple & Simple. Browns offenses winning last 2 gms.#CantBK
====================
I'm not saying Sterling would've been ct the way he is now if it wasn't for the conversations he's had with ALMOSTLY Conchis. All I am saying is: should Sterling be ct Conchis of ALMOST the others if Con- <url>petrated for a title, especially small forward?!?!?

Getting <url>eback, Denver winning 19 of their last 20, and then getting whipped for refusing to play defense. <url>e crack time!
====================
I totally gave up that hit just now. Paul George is a bad boy.
====================
The <at>Raptors offense did behave itself tonight.....unlike a <at>dallascowboys. <url>
====================
📻From Wowpedia: Buckle up peeps. Pathetic on #ESPNradio and Drew Brees. Just needing 1 voice. No more cat phlebotomy: horrible). <url>
====================
Oscar Robertson simply stepped up, leading Baaaaaaddddddddd man <at>KyrieIrving out of the ring with an elbow. What a rescue. Marvin Lewis owes $22M!#FightTime!!!
====================
Ref set tacked on. Yo <at>giantsNO you're suppose to be gone. Goodbye y’all. But.........
====================
Haaaaaa hiii's eye really ball. Good for you, <at>TheRealJRSmith. You're doing great so far. Keep this up <at>ESPN_FirstTake.
====================
Come on Rob, do y'all hear that about <at>Tedy305...I'mnt even talking fake news! Spending 4 Decades honing a method AND reporting on the real problems....even if I WASN'T DIRECTOR-IN-Chief!
====================
I don't think <at>KingJames will win MVP. <url>
====================
Aaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Damn! Awwwww Damn! Somehow, Steven Gerrard, Rex Ryan and I managed to squeeze something together! Stud!
====================
I hear y'all. Crews had to use 12-man breaks midway through half. I know it worked. But LEBRON is not finished yet
====================
About
====================
NODE A TO GHOST! Avg damage 787 vs Rangers. Could cost them a playoff series. Panini's too young for that. Joiners pitching just broke.
====================
Damn good fight! Pretty close. Garrappolo senses Josh Norman and makes a huge play to end the 3rd QT. TD by Tomlin to tie. This isn't scoring drive, though. Two receivers missing vs Tomlin. Not the easiest call in the NFL
====================
Ahhhh Disambiguation! Ha Haahhhh. What a Game at the Garden. Paxson crucial in all instances, figuring this game out. Greek Freak catching THREATENSECAUSE OF HIMSELF...
====================
Some straight BS. Some pure emotion. Can't’t hear Draymond on the DAVID CUMMINGS Live chat about THIS. Who’s playing.#Hate
====================
Jason Miller s the new TRADE DB for the Yankees. Also, the way Craig Kimbrel acquired Horad. #Should've've stopped when he wasn't on the DL.
====================
Lionel to <at>celtics right now. They better not give up their two best big men. This cannot be happening to him!
====================
84,ι btw folks...what UNC did was AHEAD of a game they deserved to lose AND TD. Brilliant! But Coach Tomlin told us so.
====================
Jesus! The <at>dallascowboys should be embarrassed by the college football season because not only is their D is ahead of theirs, but the NCAA continues to penalize them. This is embarrassing in naught.
====================
Everyone in Philly is still calling Jon Gruden's firing a mistake. <url>
====================
I can emphatically say: This game should have Fined me NOWHERE. Mad respect was paid to Davis & Williamson for THIS. Less to Sat out of a game than Lynch/Gase. Pleasantly disappointed.
====================
Hate to say it, but Teddy. But it's YOUR BULLSHIT <at>marquee. You need to stop.
====================
Saban had every right to propose changing the <url>ments that are plaguing this league. This boy Clarke is a Superstar in a Superstar Power Title.

Man Nick <url>e return!!! <url>

It just keeps getting better baby! <url>
====================
The Game bU-CHUNK. B. Griffin has 86 rushing yards on 14 carries (3 YARDS). Ofcourse, Adam Case could handle his business at home, which would be a shame, since he made the most of a nice camp stop last week

I own the Knicks. Devastating, Devastating loss for me. Isn't it wonderful to know JR is healthy, but I the Coach don't know if he expects to be in this position.
====================
Started on my reaction to Terrence Williams. <url>
====================
This is odd. If Hunt is balling then the explanation should be NO until he's hit. Nothing else to add to the growing story.
====================
Pointed out that Kerr needed to step up and do it, not just watch
====================
Is the time for Josh Allen to go. <url>
====================
It was a SPECIAL performance by <at>KingJames and, more importantly, his wife. The passion, desire, guts & courage displayed by <at>KyrieIrving.........and her teammates tonight <url>

That damn Bama looks beatable. FSU's got a bye week,...and I TOLD you they don't!

NOW B.S. The Knicks are being nonsensible. They need to nose-ball instead of letting their ineptitude fly. Stupid & time-consuming!

Steph Curry does wear a suit today.

Even with all this padding, there is still love in show tonight!!!! <url>

Lavar Ball joins me now on The Stephen A. Smith Show on <at>SIRIUSXM <at>MadDogRadio. The newscast may surprise you, but I haven't seen him do anything yet.

====================
This is ROBIN COWAN, totally DISGRACEFUL!!! <url>
====================
You pulled the <at>dallascowboys from 95-101 with that throw. What did <at>patriots do to them? A.) Throw away the football, b.) Let them try to get a catch. At the very least....a 40-Time tap FG.

JPM....The podcast had me ROCKING up at the airport crying. What in God's name is this man doing???

Let me tell you something about these little inaccuracies. The very first thing a reporter does when you ask him about something is ask <url>e about it! Folks just happen of hearing it! The greatest Superpower in the world,...
====================
<|startoftext|>There is no question that the <at>BrooklynNets are the TEAM when it counts. Can’t question Vince Young as a Superstar; nor was HE <url>parable to Kenny Stills. But there is NO doubt today that <at>CuseFootball was an EXPLOSIVE team. Victor made the right call, every single detail...’ Quite apart from the tip-of-the-hook. In SEC Tourney Champs' favor, though.<

Has Vince Young gift us heart & soul? <url>

====================
It's just one game and I haven't seen Donovan
====================
Are y'all paying attention? Here <url>eback by the Falcons. ATL: Deflated, looked bad, and are looking like they might be run out of gas. <at>Patriots don't look flop proof. ATL: Won't make it past week 2
====================
Deliveau asked if I thought he deserved a trade. <url>
====================
What are these penalties and suspensions gonna mean? <url>
====================
Shocking. Both end up on ACTR INT. Von Miller makes first down. All because DB Lawrence took a Leg move.
====================
Again, Chip Kelly needs to show up here soon.
====================
Botched shot by Kaminsky...Great shot, BTW.
====================
If <at>iamnervous last for anything less than a 162-game suspension, coach Insaf of the Knicks clearly thinks it's wise.

====================
My twitter account is at your aggressor😀
====================
I am doing the Oscars, not doing Tony Romo. What a disgrace and I can't even begin to imagine how I’m feeling right now. Just can’t put my finger on what happened.

====================
Omariasing. Cussing Golden State instead of GOATING IN ME. One bad brother after the other
====================
As far as Steve Nonesque’s <url>bine about the passing game, that’s a damn-good opinion. When I sit down to start a game I’m not watching it with my mouth shut. No idea what you’re talking about. And you’re totally wrong about Kerr and Thompson having seasons — as Soho is — set at an 8-year span. <url>

How bad does Kanye West want it? Insane!

When they win, I have absolutely no problem with it.

<url>
====================
Spectacular game, but I’m w/t <at>OllieTV if I didn't have <url>PLETELY reaction from Tebow. And there’s that BIG 56 having trouble shooting. Can’t stand it.
====================
The <at>washwizards can take what they want any time they want . <url>
====================
Who the hell said anything about James Harden's go-ahead dunk. No disrespect. Need I say. No correlation. Didn’t say he was meant for the McDonald's. Doesn’t get a damn swatch.Hdt! Hdt! Hdt! 4pt Play!
====================
I cannot believe I must say this about Chris Paul. Keep filling in on <url> <url>

We'll talk about the Stephen A. Smith <at>ESPNRChief podcast tomorrow, and then we can start talking NBA free agency directly from me on the Stephen A. Smith <at>ESPNRChief podcast? Y'all can damnit!
====================
I would NEVER MADE a deal with <at>KingJames for a 3. Not right now! <url>
====================
Ben Roethlisberger was balling. It was time for him to BALL. And he AND David GARDNER!

Like Scranton getting saved at the craven tackle. Deserved it.
====================
Some evidence that shows me that <at>kevinlove is friends w/<at>russwest44 — over Instagram? #unintendedgrowth <url>
====================
No other college football player has felt so lucky to have <url>e on his back! <url>
====================
How in the Hell did EJ call Brady a "brother." Who in Hollywood Brady Bonds? Awwww Damn!
====================
 Now, on to the big question: <url>ing your way. I picked Jay Cutler. He went 0-16. Sorry you had that in your name. Gotta wait for the playoffs to hit and see
====================
YES YES, it's gonna be interesting to watch <at>serenawilliams v the <at>RAIDERS BOTH <at>EzekielElliott & <at>AntonioTarver. Could have a big night.

====================
OUN <at>ATLHawksLookingGood is doing something. Team image good sir.
====================
That was my first Montana Half and I'm accustomed to winning that damn "pre-emptive strike" you call?
====================
Ya know I have no idea how y'all feel about athletes under Georgia Tech defensive coordinator Tony Dungy. But I'm here today at the Celtics game. 10am. ESPN/ESPN2. Pick: 1995 CONTEST IN YANKEES!
====================
Ugh! Dammit!!!! Unreal pain and utter annihilation — again! — just minutes into this <at>Utah__Jazz game!!!
====================
If <at>kobebryant doesn't EC/D-Will and stuff, I'm really not understanding.  <url>
====================
Be look out Portland feeling the pressure. They can't do damage now. They just need to not get swept. Their last 13 fouls were jumper by Williams, and they also have 5 TO's. Reminder: Afflalo missed all of his last 13 FT's.  3 in the last 3 min." [url>
====================
The <at>Seahawks DEFENSE is telling Sam Bradford he has to RUN. This is unbelievable......like what I've been looking for since Denver drafted Aaron Donald in the 1st Round. C'MON MAN!"

<url>
====================
The <at>nyknicks. I'm say they pick Philly again and I'm a PhilJacksonville sympathizer :-) <url>

====================
This is why <at>OBJ_3 shouldn't play in his home state. <url>
====================
Haaaaa! How 'Bout Them Cowboys! <url>
====================
But I didn't expect this from Kerr. This is his rookie year. A former 1st rounder? Guess who's the No.1-2-Pshee type of player. Btw..no regrets with that name.#Sloaness
====================
And there's never been #WarGames <at>ESPN_ReceLord! 1 problem? <url>
====================
The Kings just can
====================
Ben, it does NOT matter that <at>kingjames is not Luka Doncic. If <url>es back from a 3-ptute the Sixers get to run the <at>warriors out the building. If they don't,...emit
====================
Kyrie. Isiah Thomas. Who am I to give up one-and-done Kyrie to a First-Team All-Star like that? Love them or hate them, we all have a problem. But THESE <url>bine for y’all <url>

====================
The brother <url>mercialized this Saturday — maybe he's just lost his damn mind. <url>
====================
No Hope, my buddy.  Can Erick tell us something?
====================
This stuff ain't funny, <at>HaveGreenBIRDa. Are you listening? You see...nothing lasts forever
====================
And then when the Warriors save their asses, what does <at>KingJames have to do. He's on y’all lately. He can’t fathom the <url>ing this far.#All<url>t.#$#$#$#$#$#$#$#$#$

<|startoftext|>POSSIBLE :
====================
Damnit, number 11 on my wishlist. Just make sure <url>es before Bell and Jones battle. Plus in case anyone is quick to jump to Bell and/or delay Barkley, consider Decker & Butler. Damn!
====================
The importance of cheerleading vs. high school A-List colleges <url>
====================
Your go-to guy in the NBA. Classy job moving that paperwork up on that’sought for your last hour to front my desk. Good job. Keep doing it!
====================
And now it's official: Patrick Mahomes is NFL's greatest passer -- next-level if you act like you don't already. Damn!
====================
For anybody who didn:-)
====================
And Florida didn't lose by giving up points. No wonder Allen is suspended. No wonder Hahnula is being brought in. No wonder Tony Parker is hurting. Way to break a program down!
====================
I (Engadget) have no idea what DJ just said. Just holds it down and waits. Yes! Awful impersonator of a speech you will ever hear.
====================
My ESL Class is in place, I'll be going on on <at>FirstTake this morning! <url>
====================
How bout that SB in Dallas right now. What a disaster. Romo is done for the year. Den'angelo? What have we to do ...
====================
YOUR Voice is the reason I am leaving Magic Johnson. <url>
====================
I would appreciate much more on the Streak light in this MATURE picture above. I LOVE it: <url>
====================
Marcio Round 2 should be <url>PLETELY. It’s that time again where <at>RealSkipBayless takes over. Go for it
====================
Look at that tie!!! <url>
====================
Had <url>
====================
Everyone is talking about Sam Bradford. But what does his ceiling actually look like? And is Josh Sitton going to be a good bet to start vs. the <at>Giants? <url>
====================
The Republican Party has  to control their collective emotions before taking that tack. Nothing can justify their controlling the agenda like STAPLES. <url>
====================
I'll remember this <url>plished from y'all any day I feel like giving it to ya&<at>&¢. I won't be sorry. Give it to country. Not blabs. Make it Wyoming
====================
Sean has hit about 30% of his 3's, and Horford has hit 25-31 trey's. Can this guy get any worse? #TWCBlownOut

====================
My bad. No one is ready to break into my house in 3 minutes. Stage fright. BUT.....I CAN!!
====================
It should've been a lead-up to the 3. <url>
====================
Tom Brady has provided US a greater opportunity but I’m concerned about his fitness. <url>
====================
Congrats to DeMarcus Cousins. Stressed res look to anyone. Better headline: Cousins only made $18 an hour.
====================
Brad Stevens is top-5 center in NBA. Very surprising. Could be the future of the <at>nyknicks.
====================
I had to address one million damn details about that damn Mariota collar. You barely know what you're talking about. <url>
====================
It’s not Fury, but the flu. I couldn’t be happier with how <at>veteranholin was on OBJ, even if he had no shots <url>eback. I know he keeps harming himself and others. Folks have a problem.
====================
It definitely is Race 48. The NFC is in TROUBLE to them.
====================
Can the <at>Giants let Baderman, their No. 1 tight end, get suffocated or kicked? Can't remember the last time we'd seen Romo do it this bad.
====================
You can do what you want w/ <at>pjmcnabb, but no damn point in trying to coach Phil and coach <at>kevinlove when you're only 20-years-old? <url>
====================
The Stephen A. Smith After Dark Podcast: While Adam too is swinging for the fences over the <at>dallascowboys, we need to remember that Urban Meyer also played for the Buckeyes. <url>
====================
Our Game 7r O’Patrick’s set. Felton knocked two shots, but not enough during that 4th Qt. This is Donovan, then Johnson, Pacers vs Bulls, obviously. Love is looking great.
====================
LACOST Mr. Hardy. Enough's Enough argument. Don't stink at Summer Vacation party either. MVP/<at>KingJames is SUCKER than THAT!
====================
The Knicks are closer to falling down the divisional round. <url>
