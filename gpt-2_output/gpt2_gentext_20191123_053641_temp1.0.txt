I don't understand why <url>e on Morning Drive if <url>es on NBA and Tom Izzo goes home. If he tries heck-bent, what happens?
====================
also, despite your tirade, gbjr is NOT doing it all at Chicago.  Has 7pts in 2nd Half. Not LeBron, Curry, Kuzma etc. See why at Wizards/valenciaweek. He SEES what others don't. <url> <url>
====================
that's devastating to hear's <at>KingJames say this, <at>Steph_Curry13. He knows he can't stop Delonte West. He's just trying to be honor, and that's his game.

====================
<|startoftext|>I was wrong. Never claimed Flash's efficiency is worse. Never that. It might be because of the Kings motives. Hell, maybe I'm just being lazy about saying it. Either way, his production (SG) is way up. So yes, his expectations should be higher. And he's entitled to them. But who the hell would you look to as your answer.</|endoftext|>

I know it's around the <url> or the <url>ments--but how bout yourselves, before it goes for 127-of-132 FG should itM mean. Surely YOU know better than turning the ball over.
