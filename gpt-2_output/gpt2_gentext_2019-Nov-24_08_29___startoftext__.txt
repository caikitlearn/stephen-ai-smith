My thoughts on President Donald Trump on Stephen A. Smith <at>MadDogRadio Show: <url> <url>
====================
I don't see a bigger problem with Josh Gordon's off. Yards in 4. Every time he's open. Touchdown!
====================
Stephen A. Smith After Dark Podcast: The <at>nyjets decided I said they'd take <at>OBJ_3 would they?

====================
Jerry Jones <url>ing at you right now. Can't believe he's on tv
====================
$&<at>$ please. I take it back. I deserve this. Simply put, I have given’
====================
Look at what we here for <at>GetUpESPN. I don't have to explain anything to them. I'm answering to the fan base, not them.
====================
Howard said there's talk about the Knicks moving forward with Melo and that they might not get a first-round bye.

<url>
====================
What the hell is going on? Jesus. <at>FloydMayweather looks nervous. Evidently, he needs to act like an author/expert to avoid a draw. He simply can't do that. Oh, he might lose this fight.
====================
To Zion's Estranged: Thank God this 14-year-old girl didn't have to cry. She didn't need to. <url>

📻#ESPNRadio <url>
====================
Dame <url>ing your way tonight...ask Pauper why Molitor didn't get his money sooner.
====================
How The <url>eback by Connor Barth. Is just wonderful. A rare moment of LOSNESS on the part of the <at>BrooklynNets defense. Fair shake the reigning NL Cy Young Award winner. No surprise here.
====================
Btw, Jimmy's a baaaaddddddd man. I'm <url>ing at you right now debating whether you want to hear this: <url>
====================
I don't think <at>KingJames is THAT guy.Buffalo is clearly the best team in the NBA but how do they beat the LARs?
====================
What a game. What a game. What a game. Let’s’ help God F**** up Jerry Jones again. <at>KingJames celebrates with wife and kids. Michael defends himself. James gets beat up. He has his reasons why <at>KingJames will rather avoid being traded. Hmm...just saw. So Big Baller vs <at>RealSkipBayless. Just like that!
====================
Gotta talk Powerlifting today with my man <at>RealSkipBayless. Just wanted to take a moment to let you know: <url>
====================
I farted a lot last night. Awwww Damn!
====================
That is a DISGRACEFUL omen FOR Khabib. Nagy should have been ejected immediately. And <url>pletely punished. As ppl like Javale McGee want <at>EzekO6 to do, though, he should not have been SUSPENSIONED. I AM GOING TO READ THIS!
====================
Devastating shot by Kerr. I can't wait to see what LeBron and KD do next..#LeBronKerr <url>
====================
Okay let's see what Drew Brees throws at this point. He has just 5 TD Takes. #NotSmallTake
====================
TES is telling. Good lawd -- no decency -- here <url>
====================
The greatest <url>plishment in sports! <url>
====================
Acquiring Amar'e Stoudemire at No. 2 may be the most Texas' secure pick since Buck Showalter, <url>plished it for the Blue & Gold. <url>
====================
Talking more NBA Free Agency. NFL Playoff action and what's to do before we see LeBron vs. the Lakers. #ESPNradio
====================
Before anyone even asks, here's the BEST way to get Luke. He's in the house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
====================
Still, Coach K is no joke. Looked like a clown at this game...from above!
====================
A-Rodgens2 has stepped up. He's done nothing today to show that he's not a baaaaaaadddddd man. And now that Beasley death threat has <url>e to Dallas, BBall can be scary for a game. I'm told BBall will be playing some bro.' <url>
====================
Knicks Btw...for now if it wasn't for Porzingis' aggressiveness. Keep it down. Love Porzingis. Stop whining and whining. Don't lose sight of what youre trying to say. Hey, who's the problem? If ya lost, I'm gonna break you today😅
====================
What the hell is he doing, Gregory! I just saw that Watson has <url>e to <at>MiamiDolphins in a pillow fight. No boxing I see of Sir-Muhammad Obaid. Don't worry. I'm not feeling that." <url>
====================
The best shot one can hope for at this point is destruction. The <at>warriors are mere puppets of <at>michaelIrving with regard bureaus of baseball, fencing and even basketball. End of discussion
====================
Undisputed kill on Shaq. He's a champion against a contender. But thereooooooooooooo......
====================
Btw folks, to <at>KingJames matters don't have to be nickel and selling tickets to games. It CAN happen. He's <url>ing big time.
====================
The low blow came at the right time! <url>
====================
Thanks for all of support. I appreciate it too. I'm very, very sorry. But I don't want anyone else harming ourselves by supporting fake news!
====================
I do not believe that inside 8 should be banned from ACC schools <url>
====================
Because it’s summer. <at>KingJames will be at his best on July 19th. And GS is doing his job. Mayfield is done. Adams’s years are nigh. Rondo, Ga. reaching his prime
====================

====================
James Harden and Tony Parker.....Yes! I know Tony Parker is going up 3-Dr coming off a 3 last night. But damn...it will rain. It’s time to Go <url>petitive. <url>
====================
Brock Osweiler. Great job just now
====================
Terrible pass by Wilson to DeMarcus Cousins, who were both above-average pocket go-getters. Bottom line: if Cousins had 5 or 6 this is a big game, b/c he safety can play. Bottom line: if Cousins has bad passes this is his 2nd garbage time over the last 2 weeks
====================
WHEN.......... <url>
====================
The almost certain elimination of <at>dezbryant by <at>kingjames . Damn!
====================
How can I forget this: a quick glance at LEBRON blills their twitter have me asking this tough question:

====================
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! Championship game. Evidently, Colin Kaepernick did the pt for the <at>nyjets vs <at>celtics. Get over it. We can deal w/o that. Was just saying ANTONIO Brown didn't deserve that pay slap on his jersey.#Defalaan
====================
Two awful losses bodes very well for <at>Yankees.

====================
This is all I have to say about that <url>mentator: <at>Browns are bailing on the <at>Colts.#GoodLord!

 <url>
====================
Garrett (R-HI) <url>
====================
It's about that time. <at>FirstTake in the house on ESPN right now. Holla
====================
I said DAMNIT NY Jets fans that you y’all shouldn’t lose this game because you kept going — despite mistakes and injuries — and Ray McDonald reportedly called NY Coach R.I.P. Tell me how could y’all get that decision maker out of <at>OBJ_3 instead of just Martin Lawrence?
====================
It’s called a cuss word, bro. But I’m one damn liar: You do not know damnit how I use the word? If you do, shut the hell up and look int y’all: You think I actually like that — whatsoever — though I could easily be picking sides or switching from one ally to another? Damn!
====================
Right now, he's looked phenomenal. Just sensational. When he's not off the field, he's iconic.
====================
I fight all the time and I know what it is to be part of something like <at>FloydMayweather's legacy. But nothing will set me back than believing in this brother: Maidana. He’ll be missed...back on <at>FirstTake in the next hour.#SuperBBox

John Wall had a better career, but I see Jon Gruden coaching him a bit harder now. That being said, Gruden hasn't faced as many QB <url>bases as Drew Brees. I'm still waiting for <at>InitialTake

What an explosion!! Curry blows past <at>BenSimmons6. I mean....He's a BAAAAAAAADDDDDDDN Deal!!!

====================
Damnit, no way in hell Bill Belichick should be in the news for leaving the New England Patriots. They were considered one of the great teams of all time
====================
The attack went down, apparently from the fan inside the Giants End zone. Man, I CANNOT see how this makes any difference.
====================
Karl Towns is SPECIAL!! <url>
====================
Dame <url>eback. Day 2 of this damn series is all about Luck. Call me up D-Rose. 888.Maddog6

Just wanted to take a moment to reach out and thank all of y'all for supporting me and my man <at>Max_Kyoung for this incredible weekend. See y'all tomorrow on <at>FirstTake, then on <at>FirstTake tomorrow. I might need a brick on the damn first try.

For those wondering what <url>ing.....beyond figuring out how to play CFB or playing in the NFL..I'm here right now. Can't wait. Y'all:
====================
I’m back in the house today on <at>ESPN_FirstTake. Check it out: <url>
====================
It’s just around the corner when Kyle Arrington, one of the league’s top rebounders and key defender, actually returns to the <at>ATLHawks. <at>LAClippers lucky man!!!!!!
====================
He is one of the greatest ever. Love how he thinks he knows all......and ME!!!! <url>
====================
I got news for <at>Lakers fans tonight: they can still order their milk and sugar today. At least until Monday. <url>
====================
Puh-leeze <at>hsouza03. I don’t give a damn about your feelings on my show, <at>MadDogRadio. Why even try -- having never done so with <at>OBJ_3. If you’re depressed, I’ll-support-you attitude. Because you know better. Why shoot ourselves in the foot?
====================
That's right I said it! Season ends with <at>OBJ_3 very proud o u <url>

Nrama with you <at>storytellers — sorry you're distractions. <url>ing more content. And, ofcourse... <at>StephenCurry30 is showing out. What can go wrong? Won’t go away.

The greatest superstar in history joins us to talk about #UFC229. #ESPNradio <url> <url>
====================
I was thinking when Jordan made the Finals, they would lose every series. There are no playoffs Minny has ever won in 13 playoff appearances. Yours Truly is an apoc Hier!
====================
Hey ppl. It's you <at>BrandonBayless3. You stole my attention. What do y'all want me to do? Go home and grind?
====================
Him
====================
About <url>e on NOW <at>SportsCenter. PPL don't show up on THIS day. We'll explain later.
====================
A disservice to the fanbase and the baseball the Phillies have to say a damn about it all afternoon. Sorry folks.
====================
Big-time stop by Marshall. What a game. GS pulls this off, and Cutler has to keep throwing. Takes a sack, but still manages to get 1st down. Te'o reaching short-yardage after holding onto ball is impressive
====================
Bryce Harper. Trust <url>
====================
Major. How'S the $$$. Round 3. <at>MuhammadAli takes out Michio Horn! Roll Tide! Stay in Me

He felt it necessary to speak out. He’s never done it before!

Wow! What a Game. These last four minutes are where the momentum really believes. #Tyson_NL

Much of #NBA is shit right now. #ESPNradio <url> <url>
====================
Ahhhhhh...JonnyQuansky....that Baaaaaaaaaddddddddd man! Two 3's just now, man! Horrible puck handler, poor man's <url>ing back from far away from <url>ple. He looks eerily calm and collected now, despite all this damn nonsense.
====================
Fyi....look at my brotha <at>RealSkipBayless. You're a BAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD man!
====================
Stuart. You sound like you want to be -- what you put in the tankers are usually the ones to blame. What a ridiculously overabundance of talent. Afraid you wouldn't touch BBall
====================
Yo, <at>TheRealRandall9975, I'm sounding like the MAN. <url>
====================
The <at>Giants have every single player on their bench except for Posey, who has to make an out. I'm honestly shocked. I expected loose ball and nothing else. That aside from Posey being on as many pitches as usual. Er...nothing else.
====================
That was a Flagrant 1 by Herm Edwards. Stupid no-show gesture. Score tied......at  Contested Period !!!
====================
I picked the Browns to get what they deserved. <url>
====================
Me being on Hot 97 in NYC, it’s awful. Every sound is blocked off, and the stadium has been scorched -- ONLY the most deformed people show up. The lights are on out, but there’s still plenty of time. I leave feeling fine.#BlockedOut
====================
1st and Goal. Now Bro! Deal with it!
====================
TUpper Marrow Growler! Came in Tebow's first go at Brady. Now <at>Panthers’ beef up. See y’all at 2:20 p.m. EST.
====================
Here we go again on <at>MikeAndMike this AM. On the same show as <at>RealSkipBayless and <at>kellythiebaud. You trying to take <at>KingJames at face value.
====================
Jimmy Butler didn't get to do too cool w/Horn. <url>
====================

====================
I’m waiting to see the press conference. It boggles my mind that the <at>Browns would want to lose to anyone.
====================
Is there a chance Thabo Sefelosha could be a Top 5 pick? Is it possible for Winston to pick a QB in the top 3? <url>
====================
These are some of my mistakes thus far...inappropriate language. 

<url>
====================
Damn! Looks like they both took their eyes off the ball. Yeah, I see you're a conservative kid, Tom Brady. Don’t be discouraged by my <at>BrownBlazers defense. I’ll see y’all eventually. I know I do. So I did warn you. In the lead-up to the playoffs. Everyone knew that
====================
McCall has Pelicans in 19 thus far. #24’s make sense after all
====================
Girl, <at>TBIriffin1 is sitting in Tuscaloosa and not wearing a suit. Doesn't help that he got beat up though.
====================
Ladies & Gentlemen, had better deal with the press on this immediately — as I speak. The game is over. I order <at>Steelers
====================
I think the <at>Pacers are looking pretty damn good right now. This is getting very interesting.
====================
<|startoftext|>Embiid just caught fire in Houston. He's averaging more 3-pointers per game than Westbrook and Bird. Hibbert can't guard him!
====================
Greg Hardy was suspended for 10 games for assaulting another man. Would you accept a slap on the wrist? <url>
====================
I don't want to hear anything about <at>JOSH_LOBERTS. Sick of hearing about what he's done.
====================
It's early, but we ain't SIT for <at>FlakeTV <at>MIT. We're here. At this hour. And the number to call in until 9pm EST.
====================
My bad. Didn't see <url>ing. But I saw it. Hasn't happened yet.....again

If James Harden has to take shots every single day just for this, I swear that's $200M a year! #BUCKLEUP

Let’s get this straight: this is what the Hell is going on. Whaaaaat??? Don’t bother asking me this bro! I'm kidding if I suspect something’s
====================
I don't think that the <at>nyknicks are capable of wearing <at>kobebryant down to the last play. Could be a 5, but not 50

I’ll be back on <at>SportsCenter at 1p et talking <at>dak. You know I'm ready. Me? Not gonna happen. Not until I see <at>RAIDERS!
====================
<|startoftext|>It's about that time. I’m done. Four-straight wins’t mean the world to me. I’m gone. Won’t hide from the fact that I have NEVER HAPPENED. FINALLY! So I am. So sorry I have to say this: I QUIT....ABOUT....Stephen A. Smith’s. I bow out every single damn hour I’m on vacation, on my own for the rest of the
====================
Apologies to all the <at>dallascowboys and all the others who wanted to throw around <at>terrellowd​. I totally understand his frustrations. Certainly mine. But I said what I said and I mean what I mean: <url>
====================
Run, Run RUN.......NO!!
====================
At some point, <at>KingJames should 'make up his mind' how he feels about everyone else. Because I have NO DISRESPECT for anyone other than myself!
====================
I was just as disgusted by Lee Aren't Caught stealing that Awful Black Vote Folks gave him after Black <url>ing and Rosen of the NY Test Crew pissing off non-Yankees. <url>
====================
I did not see <at>Terrellowens faint. He was fierce. Why did Tebow lose 4 Clips. Just like I saw him do pt. Gotta pick this one up!
====================
Haaaaaa!!!!! Spike Lee crying in pain after eating a piece of Flagstaff Butter. My God!!!!!
====================
The crossover star is <at>DwyaneWade. The brother propelled the Pacers into near disaster. And now we got his #SECONDBirthday. <url>
====================
Yours truly within earshot of <at>RealSkipBayless in that chair. And I love <url>ing back from the break. But look what you’re hearing. D-Wade ain’t missed yet. Still time to do some damage before the <at>Warriors open the playoffs
====================
My Brother, Special Counsel Robert Wood that damn Roger Goodell is sitting in a chair with <at>RSherman_25 with Robby Swann at heart. Cleave to <at>walla. Bro. Don't even watch. Stay off the hook. <url>

Ladarius Green is gone. Sick of us all whining and ogling our pro-Bowl gms. Can't be WONDERFUL.

Can't believe the Cowboys just lost this year. Romo is done ??Cowboys fans should be ready to get this man....literally anywhere. Field goal after field goal is gonna do ya..Haaa
====================
I don't think <at>dezbryant will win the Heisman. <url>
====================
I think <at>StephenCurry30 is making his 7th ejection in as many games. Yeah...that's right, he ejected 8 MORE times. Kobe is just saying ejections are proof you can't play. I know you can easily play 2 or 3 way & still lose; ejections aren't bad in THAT situation.
====================
Louis R-Louis never disappoints. Even when he's down
====================
R_R_. I <url>e on, <at>TheAaronRodgers10. I won’t apologize. I never said he made mistakes. I said he was great, but that he’s been through a lot. This way, people will recognize him for his grit, his heart, plus his hustle. Deny! & make us all feel better right then see here. #BuckleUp

Here's why finding a new coach is such a long shot... <url>
====================
Now siserd <at>RealSkipBayless has the vote to bench Nkemdiche for BLUE. Folks would crucify him —1) and regret it —2) if they didn 't know what they were getting themselves into —3) Gasol probably told people on the plane............that's how he was feeling. Nothing more....
====================
Oh Lord. The one time I'm trying to tell you, I can barely hear.

The NFC South is officially the Contest. Tune in to #ESPNews to hear <url>ing your way. #ESPNRadio #ESPNews <url>

Awwwww Damn! My Cowboys are blowing this series to start this evening. How in God's name do we want a rematch??? Jesus! Get drug tested.

Awwwww Damn! The <at>HoustonRockets are starting to attack the perimeter. Curry can’t block his shots and Harden just can’t find anyone on the frontline. Who gives a damn.#Damn!

If Sam <url>es back from this TKO ... GOOD! <url>

====================
&<at> Four years from now, Kawhi will have a career-high 33pts.
====================
Talk about a damn turnaround with the <at>nyknicks. After the blowout in Tampa, Sonny & Dom have been winning gms in previous seasons — with Hester breaking his collarbone in July — which means DAMN to <at>TeamYunt27.....where the hell is <url>ing from!
====================
YYYYYESSSS!!!! Cardale Jones forces Nat'L read on Cam Newton. 38-for-38, 39 from 40 yards away. #Finals!!!!!!

Omg! An ultimate FOUR. Mad love to my man <at>RealSkipBayless. He's an ALL-STAR, He's ESPNswear -- O.o
====================
I actually don't think he's THAT good!
====================
Somebody have a point! <url>
====================
<|startoftext|>The incredible thing about Jazz at this point is that no title-caliber player — no 1-and-done player in this game — has ever in their history banned 300-and-hard-serve alcohol in a game like this. Hell, we're praying this is permanent. This is what people are accustomed to. Folks, especially minority players, drink as much as they can — whatever it takes, b/c of the NFL. I've known J.R. as long as

Make no mistake: <at>Money23Green is money23green. But that was not his ONLY BB-Ball season w/ the <url>pared to resume back in 2008. I don't think anyone knew that.

Btw folks, I've watched the Tony Romo's I saw last night for the Cowboys. Was not an MVP. My take:

Btw...I feel bad for DGWJ because <url>

DeMarre Carroll's new deal with the <at>RamsNFL could be in jeopardy as well. <url>

OMG I just saw the Cowboys SPLIT...twice. With Revis gone and Indy's D-Will gone. How in God's name can it happen?<at>PatsFan25 in a rocking

What would be a good trade for the Warriors​?

====================
Really loving <at>FloydMayweather v. <at>MannyPacquiao. Nothing else to say. Mayweather should be dead at the top of the octagon. But has he got a try-out? Manny should've been out 13 or 14 rounds in the first place.
====================
Athletic coaching isn't good enough for me...
====================
Sorry, <at>AtlantaFalcons. I meant I’m out of the league entirely. Keep grinding bro!

So <at>carmeloanthony stopped the bleeding. And....him being ejected does not help.#PerfectWorthMeSuffice
====================
How can <at>OBJ_3 look this way without <at>DwyaneWade at center? Clearly, he's younger, which means more power play time. That's the <at>OBJ_3 we're looking for

Two things I have about <at>MikeAndMike today:
1.) The Seahawks are trading Jimmy, a 1-Year, $100M deal.

I don't want to hear about what I shouldn't have seen. <url>

What the hell was Wiseman of the future thinking after the All-Pro missed a 47-pt FG. The incredible thing about Wiseman is that he never had a turnover in his first 82 2nds. I'm going to say what I will 2 say <at>RealSkipBayless.

For those who were wondering if we should start seeing Luka Doncic from beyond the arc or Donovan Mitchell from beyond the foul line, YES we should. NBA teams need to do it. 83 bench minutes. #w/Image

This is basically the Season of Bad Boys I've been waiting for. Of course there are still NFL Playoffs to look forward to, but here's a plan b/c
====================
The <at>packers offense lags badly vs the <at>Eagles CB’s. They move the football too early into game. Appreciate the praise. #ThankGodWeMadeMe&$<at>
====================
Klay Thompson should've played for the Wizards. Not anymore <url>petition. <url>
====================
Now! The <at>celtics have Crawford on the floor for <url>ing 6 points tonight over a 101-68
====================
LaVar Ball is the most recognized player in the league. I'm champ. <url>
====================
Trump gives ups and misses when it suits him to <url>
====================
Btw....let me not fail to <url>municate on this Jay Cutler question. That's the job of the acting like he's questioning a 10-year-old's love for PEACEFUL FREAK!
====================
Damn! Steph and I are out of DAMN <url>mons shoes right now! And this brother is regressing so he may be out cold right now
====================
I gotta say, I'm very happy with the Giants this far. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, especially up front. They still haven't shown enough. Can't seem to handle this pressure.
====================
What a game. Pray for me nothing less!
====================
Ppl think I brought it. Let me know your thoughts 😅#
====================
Kae is a better shooter (LeBron) AND freer (Stephen) to shoot througout. What else do we need to know??? #Revis24 <url>

I just want to take a moment to thank everyone for the support. Liege, Roll Tide, etc. Hope you guys are having a good weekend. Ain't bad!!!!

I thought Pat Riley was Intelligent enough to address this <url>ment and I stand corrected. He did not sound as assertive as others....not the weakest point. Inconsistency. All that and Riley wasn't irate towards some ignorant ignorant white Southpaw
====================
Now Gary [Blount] is balling. He's a superstar at the moment. But the man hasn't looked so fulfilled this postseason. I can't wait until then

Regarding #NBAFinals, I have an AMENITY with Oren about <at>Dame_Lillard BEFORE WE'LL. Don’t get me wrong: he’s classy. But I’m holding him to a Monday 1-3x. Should Oren just sit through a week of shitty performances or is he suppose to start getting pay this week <url>
====================
I can't believe we're back in the house on <at>FirstTake — after a 3-gm break due to travel. But I gotta say, <at>KingJames looks miserable.#Blasphemy

====================
I only have one more hour before the Celtics play the Heat in Cleveland. Keep bringing it!
====================
Sam can start off the season playing the way he feels, and then he has to learn to operate on the practice squad. Just too much personality. Didn't expect it.
====================
FOXBOROUGH: That was not a shot fired by Brady. That was a leg-stepping miss by Daniels. Hasn't GUST. I applaud Daniels for that.
====================
Big Ben intercepted. Rookie-of-the-year, NFL-containing.2 him pregame and postgame. Wow! If <url>es back from this, it’s on TNT and not the NBA Finals. It’s beautiful." <url>

There's never been any doubt about the 49er's drafting of PaSark. <url>

I don’t misstate what I said about Hunter S. Breslin got fired. I said I won’t be changing my tune about the story until he gets a job. That doesn’t mean I don’t understand folks minds & how’s. I just ain’t changing my mind right now over this. BG can fire Breslin after this or lose season. <url>

Since Paul George tore his ACL in summer league, <url>mish hasn't had more success than LEBRON —with or without the No. OF A. Right now he looks like the next David Irving. I'm just saying.

T he first 4 minutes? #ESPNRadio #ESPNews <url>

Big Ben is ABSOLUTELY missing. He is totally absent. ATL is looking like they don't want their man back at the game. This game should've been stopped. It should've been the whole "We want to see Gordon but CP isn't available.

The record for most assists by a player isnt even 3:39!
====================
73 points is nothing w/out Brandon Ingram! <url>

====================
Thought about it, <at>ReggieMillerTNT. I mean it. I'm saying it's WRONG for Wilder to be poached. Wilder would never consider sending a 1st-baller. Phenomenal offensive touch there. And Gostisbehere might have a problem this season . He's special. So why is Wilder interested in landing with Minnesota instead of Colorado?

The one time, “damnit Tom’ it’s his turn. He has the guts to call me again before the season is over. Let’s do it!!!
====================
It's all about fun. I like loud noise while playing catch. But then again, why put that <url>petition on somebody else's back pocket!

Klay Thompson would be the MVP in a best-case scenario. <url>
====================
Why the hell aren't the Knicks on the board this summer? Huh <at>kawhileonard. Maybe we should just pay Edelman $20-mil a game instead. Plus, Kap looks awful.

O.J. Simpson shouldn't really be in jail, but Bill Belichick vs. an inferior offensive line? That'll talk deuces
