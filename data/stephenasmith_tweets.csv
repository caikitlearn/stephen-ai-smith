"Help!!!!!!!!!!  I can't decide which Tournament to go to: ACC or the Big East. I know the Big East is better this year but I love UNC"
"It's real sad Syracuse' legs are so tired. I have a feeling they may have beaten Louisville tonight"
"<at>FD0III I go hard at everybody. That's who I am. But I love skip. We've been friends for 15 years. No worries."
"<at>sistersukie didn't do either. would've gone had it been UNC vs. Duke. I knew Florida State would lose to Duke."

"<at>realdubaya Anyone from Toronto is alright with me. LOVE that city. Folks think they are ladies in LA, NY, etc. They don't even know :)"
"<at>David_Gardner Appreciate the support, David. Thanks a lot. BTW....I thinking of heading back to Radio soon. We'll see what happens"
"<at>audreycnn Hey! Sent you a message minutes before this one. Let me know if you got it."
"Don't know about anyone else, but although I love UConn, I still thought Memphis -- 25-straight wins -- should've gotten a # 1 seed"
"Either way, I love March Madness, so I'll enjoy myself. B/t that and the NBA playoffd, it should be a very nice Spring"
"Especially if I get assigned to the Miami/Atlanta playoff series (smile!!!)"
"Enjoy your week, everyone. Here's hoping not a single solitary sould contributes to the unemployment rate"
"I mean ""Soul."" Forgive my grammatical error, please."
"<at>image180 Well, here's your shot to change it. All you need to do is win it all. It's there for the taking."
"<at>mdvanbruggen We'll see. They didn't get it done last year, but they're shooting free throws better this year. I'm rooting for them."
"<at>DryerBuzz Girl, I don't know how to follow. Just learning this stuff. Plus, I doubt I'll consistently have the time."
"<at>bgeustac Good to see ya. Sexy photo too. Evidently, you're trying to get yourself in trouble :)"
"<at>DryerBuzz I'll learn it eventually."
"Reminder folks: Keep in mind SPORTS isn't the only thing on my mind. I love talking news/politics, as well. So with that in mind......"
"Is it just me or is anyone else concerned about all this spending going on in our government. I mean, what good is a job if......"
"All we're going to do is get taxed to death. I'm rooting for Obama but the man is scaring me right now"
"On a non-sports-related matter, the House passed a bill today, imposing 90 percent income tax on AIG's $165 million in bonuses. So here' ..."
"Why all the noise about the noise about this when we've already committed to spending more than $1.2 trillion? I'm really getting ticked off"
"Confession time: Although I've stayed w/ LeBron all year, everytime I see D-wade perform I question what the Hell am I thinking"
"<at>Matt2theFrank I'm going with Villanova. Duke can shoot the basketball. But I question their guard play and athleticism"
"<at>yourjustanLAgrl I'm working on it. I'm working on a few things. Stay tuned."
"<at>Matt2theFrank Nah! UNC is a good pick. I picked UConn to beat Pitt for the national title, though."
"<at>JefetheTruth Thanks, my man. Much appreciated. I'm working on it. Thinking about doing Urban Radio, too. Blame my man, Steve Harvey :)"
"<at>onezenmonk Would love to write about it. Love Barack, but he's spending too much and being overly influenced by Pelosi and Reid, to me."
"<at>mlorsch Won't pretend to be an expert, but I have loads of common sense. $1.2 trillion is $1.2 trillion. Too much damn spending."
"<at>bgeustac Hey Girl! Hope you're well. Hope that interview went well, too."
"<at>DryerBuzz I'll try my best. But as you know, I'm a very, very busy man. But I'll chime in as much as I can."
"Who's picking Gonzaga over UNC? It won't be me. I'm here to do a featured column on Blake Griffin and Tyler Hansborough"
"Hey ya'll, I'm in Memphis at the South Regionals. I knew Oklahoma would beat up Syracuse, but not like this."
"UNC better not mess things up for me, now tha Oklahoma handled their business. BTW....UConn over Ptt for the Nat'L Title."
"I think :-)"
"Complete domination by UNC. It's gonna be REAL INTERESTING to see what Hansborough and Griffin do against one another"
"Just what I thought! It's 4:04 left in the 1st Half and Oklahoma's been exposed. UNC is daring someone else to beat'em."
".........And Oklahoma's guards can't respond"
"Wrote a column on Blake Griffin and Tyler Hansbrough. Anyone interested in reading it to check it out on ESPN.Com in a few hours"

Sportscenter in the 6 o'clock hour. Allen Iverson! Who Else?"
"I think Tom Izzo is a great coach. But I can't believe Michigan State beat UConn. Cinderella's definitely alive and well"
"Fyi.......I'll be on SportReporters today at 9:30 am on ESPN -- re-airing at 12:30 pm on ESPNews. I'm picking UNC to win it."
"But Michigan State is no joke. Can't believe they won. It's a pick'em game now. You can't bet against these guys"
"I've gotta say this: I just watched my man Mike Wilbon interview LeBron. I love LeBron. I really do. But......"
"There's one pet peeve....with him an everyone else. Why call the PRESIDENT Barack Obama. How about, ""Mr. President."""
"Last time I checked, every other president was referred to that way. Even the networks call him by his name instead of ""Mr. President."""
"I don't like it"
"For anyone who's interested, I'm on 1st Take on ESPN2 today AND tomorrow with my man Skip Bayless."
"He promises to take it easy on me :-)"
"Yes Folks! That was ME blaming women for the lack of popularity with the WNBA and Womens's College Ball."

"What's up, everybody. The NBA Playoffs are here. Don't know where the rest of ya'll will be, but I'll be covering the Miami/Atlanta series."
"Atlanta should win this series in 7, but you all feel free to bet against Dwayne Wade if you like. I would not bet my $$$ against that man."
"I'm out. I've got to do 1st Take at 10 AM, Sportscenter at 11 (following Isiah Thomas' Press Conference), then Sportscenter again at 12:15."

"<at>Aaronjweaver...Thanks, my man. Appreciate the love."
"<at>Maurice_Garland...Can't front. I wouldn't be surprised if Wade goes ballistic. But Atlanta should win. Again, can't bet against Wade,though"

"<at>amdel...It's sad, but it was time. I'll definitely miss doing in the NBA draft. Absolutely loved doing it. But new times; new challenges."
"<at>mommaship I'm glad you do, Momma. Life with no challenges is stagnant life. No growth. Don't want to be that way. Too young for that."
"<at>Mita2009 All in due time, Mita. You don't believe I'd be gone if I didn't have a plan, do ya? :)"
"<at>jlamp7ft. Too late for that, my man. But actually, I'd love something better: To WORK with Barkley, Ernie and Kenny. That's a dream."
"<at>dreaavent Hey you! I'll be in LA in 2 weeks. My numbers haven't changed. Won't leave it on here. Catch me ASAP"
"<at>BHornbeckAD Never shocked by Chauncey. Love the dude. He's a good player and a great person. But one title in 6 tries doesn't cut it for me"
"<at>princepryce Grab at it, fair-weathered one. Nah! Seriously, you're right. Derrick Rose and Ben Gordon are no joke. They could win."

"Fyi.....I'm about to watch Atlanta/Miami inside Phillips Arena. Prediction: Hawks...in a semi-blowout. They'll get blown"
"....Out in Game 3 because Wade will explode. Then Game 4 will determine if Miami loses series in 5 or 7 Games"
"Chillin in Miami, I've still been watching NBA action all day. And all I have to say is...somebody had better give Ben Gordon his money"
"Seriously! How many others would you want with the ball in their hands in the clutch? He's a bad boy."
"And while I'm on the subject of the NBA, it's pretty sad to see how Detroit, for the most part, has laid down. I'd never accuse them..."
"...of quitting. But it's like they've accepted what the rest of us have: that they have no chance against Cleveland. They're done. Sad!"
"<at>LawrenceBA No way, Bruh! If Miami wins this series, it's over in 6 games..MAX...vs. Cleveland in the next round. LeBron. Enough said."
"<at>UpliftingYouth I know, but still. It was just bad. And, although I love my boy A.I., he really hurt himself by not being around. Seriously."
"<at>h_files They saved $50 million by trading Chauncey. It was about $$$ and cents, not talent and leadership. Can't know Joe-D for that."
"<at>mrjcharo I doubt it, but who knows. It's all about the Benjamins. No pun intended"
"<at>cmjoker wouldn't go that far. But Billups has been bigtime. And A.I. doesn't need to ask for a trade. He's a free agent."

"<at>NickRinaldi He should get paid. That's for sure."
"<at>Yanjmnz Didn't think about it at all. In the heat of the moment, stuff happens."
"<at>jseph1 Pacquiao. I'll be at that fight. He could lose because Hatton's naturally bigger and...now...well trained. But I'm hoping Pacquaio."
"<at>jseph1 I want to see Pacquaio vs. Mayweather BADLY! And that's not about to happen if Hatton beats him up."
"<at>PricelessToni I hear ya, Girl"
"<at>ChicoBonds Can't fight you on that way. Expected at least one good game from them."

"<at>YAli23 Lakers vs. Cleveland. Picking the Lakers in 6 Games, although I'm a bit nervous with that pick. Kobe's last chance. Now or never"
"<at>ttjakt Hard to say right now. He's hurt himself by looking petulant. Joe-D turned against him. Teams may say we don't want headaches"
"<at>ttjakt Plus...he wants to get paid. Very hard with this economic recession taking place. Charlotte's possible. Anyone else is hard to say"
"<at>TimMoore Totally agree, Tim. Been saying so for months....on both fronts."
"I'm out, ya'll. Heading out to enjoy the Miami sun. Btw....Lakers will close out Utah tonight and Atlanta has given me no reason to believe."
"...they won't fall down 3-1. I picked them to win the series in 7, believing they'd win all 4 home games. They let Miami get one. Trouble!!!"

"Yes! ESPECIALLY Skip Bayless. My tag-team partner for the last 13 years. You folks will never realize how truly wonderful that guy is."
"BTW......I'm getting a lot of comments about USA Today's article on me. I don't control what people write. They can say what they want"
"But the article wasn't all bad. It accurately portrayed I have absolutely no hard feelings toward ESPN, and that I want my own show again"

"<at>tennisgirls You still feel that way, Girl? I'd hope not."
"<at>ILovethisgame09 Absolutely not. I don't best against Money Mayweather. Baddest boy on the planet. But he's not getting any younger."

"<at>HTF21 Sorry boss. It's true. I'm gone. But it's been a wonderful ride. Didn't want to leave, but that was their call. Wish them well."

"What's up, everybody. Just wanted to give the heads up and let everyone know my new website STEPHENA.COM is up and running. Talk to ya'll"
"This is why the Lakers are going to the Finals. They amp it up whenever they need to. Plus, Yao doesn't look healthy. Bad sign."
"Hope everyone is enjoying their weekend. I plan on doing the same. Now that I've gotten my NBA fix, I'm heading to D.C. to do the same."

"<at>ShaunSyrious Yes sir! Told you they did."
"<at>Mike_Ock I guess so, Mike. Wouldn't sneeze at it. But I'd have to have other, better, opportunities with that as my side gig."
"<at>Memphisman12 Don't know yet. I imagine I will. But I have other priorities right now. Interested in exploring news and politics, too"
"<at>slykinghot1077 It's worth it, though. At least with this show."

"<at>Keelowlow Thank ya, sweety!"
"<at>Famtee13 Thanks. Much love. As for the Hawks, they'll probably get rid of Bibby. The Hawks won't offer more than $6 mi, per. He wants more"
"<at>Micachu02 Thank ya, much. Glad you liked it."
"<at>DaDoc04 That's my issue with them, man. Lakers have got to handle their business. It's not about Houston. It's about Denver and Cleveland."

"<at>Sheloves3 Heeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!! How are you? Thanks for being so nice to me on Sunday. Lovely meeting you and your friends."

"<at>KKdacoach Yes, I'm going for it, bro. Don't wnt to leave sports. Just want to do more. That's what I'm after. Don't intend to be stopped."
"Mslovely41 Thanks, Ms. Lady. Hope you liked my response to the Strawberry letter."
"<at>trelly Thank you, Dear! Much appreciated."
"It's exactly 60 seconds after the Celtics won Game 5, coming back from a 14-point deficit. Orlando just lost this series. Damn Shame!"
"I'm done with the Lakers. Finished!!! I know they'll beat Houston on Sunday, but that is not the point. This team is unreliable. Totally!"
"How can anyone possibly see the Lakers beating Cleveland at this point? Hell, they may not make it to the Finals. Denver may beat them."
"At the end of the day, Kobe has NO HELP when it counts most. His boys fold like cheap tents. That means Odom, Bynum, Gasol. Everybody."
"Btw......I've got to write a political column soon. Lies! Lies! Lies! Usually, it's most politicians. Now, it's mainly Nancy Pelosi.."
"And speaking of Speaker Pelosi, here's my question: If you have any skeletons at all, how STUPID can you be to go after the C.I.A.???"
"It's 9:59 left in the game and Orlando is leading Boston 77-61. If the Celtics come back and win this, I'm not saying Stan Can Gundy should"
"......Be fired. But I'm willing to bet the house most folks will be saying that. Remember, Orlando has given up a lot of leads this season."
"<at>ShonMoney1 Sorry, my man. Wasn't my call. There decision, but one I understand. I want to do more than NBA. More than just sports."
"<at>nickochosiete Haaaaa. My favorite was not the one I did on ESPNews, but the one I did on NBA Shootaround with Bill Walton and Rick Carlisle"
"<at>RobbieMcGowan Absolutely!"
"<at>Gymfan09 Not fair. Boston wins that series if KG and Leon Powe are healthy. Orlando is still the 3rd best team in the East."
"<at>ThisisIvan True, Ivan. But I can't see it. LeBron is on a mission. I'd be shocked if Orlando wins this series. But it could go 7 games"
"<at>BogWetsel Don't agree with that at all, Bob. Van Gundy is a damn good coach. He just needs to calm down sometimes, that's all."
"<at>cptheartist A lot of the responsibility should be placed on the players. Especially when they're good enough."
"<at>jlb0183 Not starting a thing. Remember, I've covered this league for 14 years. I know how it goes. Had they lost...Trouble!!!"
"<at>Missgoodiegoody Thank ya, Dear. I try to be as proper as possible :)"
"<at>BigLeagueWiffle I doubt I'll ever run for office. Rule of the game is to compromise oneself. But I'd love to write and talk politics. Badly"
"<at>merrillsoto No! Ofcourse I don't hate the Lakers. I just believe they're gonna let Kobe down. They won't show when they need to most."
"<at>tsurod wrong dude, sir. I didn't bury Van Gundy. I've always thought he was a really good coach. I just told you what folks would do if...."
"<at>tsurod...Van Gundy had lost, which was true. I'm happy for him. But it really should not have gone 7 games w/o KG or Leon Powe. Seriously"
"<at>gymfan09 Powe is a legitimate 6'8"" and an extra big body. If Boston had had him and KG, Boston would be playing Cleveland right now."
"<at>FawnNicole They're both good, but Adelman has done a better job with Houston than Van Gundy. Never thought I'd say that but it's true."
"<at>BigLeagueWiffle I'm working on it, fellas. I plan on doing quite a few things in the very near future."
"<at>truesportstalk The thing that's so attractive with Denver right now is its heart. The Nuggets aren't scared of anybody. And they can play"
"<at>romeyyoung No I didn't, my man. But I'l look for it."
"<at>m1ntyi LeBron and Kobe works for me. I believe the way Denver looks, Melo and LeBron will have their time. This is the time for Kobe/LeBron"
"<at>Itsyaboydward Cleveland in 7 games. Orlando is tough, but it's LeBron's time. That's just how I feel about it."
"<at>Rharcell I agree with Jerry West. More importantly, I respect him for saying it because, like me, he loves Kobe. But the truth is the truth"
"For those who care, I'm picking the Lakers to win this series in 7 games. I've lost faith in LA but the Nuggets still lack the horses"
"<at>derekfisher Good job, boss. Keep it up."
"<at>rsoussi They are! And Carmelo is coming on strong. He's establishing the fact that we'll be talking about him, along with LeBron and D-Wade"
"<at>Thatsheadlam Do everything they can to establish cap space so they can be ready to go after LeBron following next season."
"<at>Mcastro10 That's what I believe, my man. But I won't front and act like I'm sure. Denver is tough as hell."
"<at>ShaunSyrious You're right. The problem, though, is that Denver gave it to them. What does that tell you about them?"
"<at>Jkarlo76 Nope. JW says what he means, and he happens to be right. I love Kobe to death, but LeBron is just a beast. Can't deny it anymore."
"<at>thetruthsports Will do. Appreciate ya'll following me. I tweet when I can."
"<at>topflightsecuty That's a good place to be :)"
"<at>Shonmoney1 You're absolutely right. Remember, he's nearly 3 inches taller than Kobe, and has him by about 30 pounds. Melo's legit."
"<at>Sjonez I've got Cleveland in 7. Orlando is a tough matchup for them with all those perimeter shooters. But homecourt will be too much"
"<at>Mikeerickson Nope! I'm thinking Cleveland. The Lakers really ticked me off with that series vs. Houston. I'm still ticked."
"<at>FamousUmair What up, my man. Go to my website: StephenA.Com. You'll find everything right there."
"<at>DisiyaMe He certainly did better than he did in the Houston series. That's for sure."
"<at>JenaJ34 Thanks, Jena. Always appreciate knowing my opinions matter, sweety. Thanks so much."
"<at>LovelyNursetobe Yes! That's what I said. You're trying to tell me you have a problem with me saying Denver is tough after last night?"
"<at>rogemark I'm sick over it. Blake Griffin is the truth. Too bad he's going to what I consider to be a cursed franchise."
"I just blogged this: ""NBA Conference Finals: Lakers in trouble, Cavs will triumph"" http://stephena.com/?p=110"
"Check me out on two new radio interviews-- J.T. The Brick on Fox Radio and The Dan Le Batard Show: http://stephena.com/?page_id=77"
"Very impressive win by Orlando. Especially since the Magic exhausted LeBron in the process. Things are VERY interesting right now."
"<at>The_Real_Shaq And I see you, big fella. Hope all is well."
"<at>Jennellaquan ESPN had better things to do with their money, I guess. Hopefully, I'll land my own show again soon. One not limited to sports"
"<at>Its_Maniac Perhaps. But 49 points is 49 points. Your team shouldn't lost when you drop those numbers."
"<at>ChitownStu The NBA would be depressed for the entire offseason if they miss out on LeBron vs. Kobe. Plain and simple."
"<at>Brittonclassic The Clippers are not giving up Blake Griffin. They're not even bringing anyone in for workouts."
"<at>Truesportstalk Not necessarily."
"<at>Baron_Davis If this is you, BD, just reaching out to say ""What up?"" Hope all is well. I'll holla."
"<at>Intellect1girl I'm about to start working on that. It'll take some time, but I definitely have a book in my future plans."
"<at>ErocEM Not my call, my man. Networks pick who the want to pick. I don't own them, so I have no choice but to respect their decision."
"<at>Artfanatic411 Thank you, Jill. Appreciate the love very much."
"<at>PassionBucket That's hard to say. LeBron was sensational, but what makes him great is he always seems to make the right play. Hard to say."
"<at>Marc322 Absolutely! That's the one thing I can say definitively. I am definitely  a free agent."
"<at>MambaMVP24 I'm hating on the Lakers because I think they're entirely too talented to leave Kobe hanging as much as they do."
"<at>brittonclassic What's very depressing?"
"Just giving folks a heads up: you can officially call me the BasketBall Ambassador for Vitmain Waters Great Debate. Kobe vs. LeBron."
"Just giving folks a heads up: Today, I've officially joined vitaminwater's great debate -- Kobe vs. LeBron. A blog post will arrive shortly"
"I just blogged this: Vitaminwater's Kobe vs. Lebron ""The Great Debate"" campaign http://stephena.com/?p=115"
"Remember, anyone looking to interact with me tonight can catch me after the game on vitaminwater's fan page. But I'll tweet DURING the game"
"Stay with me throughout the game, peeps. I'll chime in for the duration, then you can catch me at Facebook.com/vitaminwater afterward."
"If Denver's going to have a shot a winning this series, Kenyon Martin can't treat Bynum like he's Dwight Howard. No ticky-tack fouls."
"So far this game epitomizes why there's the Great Debate about Kobe/LeBron. The Lakers, so far, won't do much to separate themsemves. Kobe.."
"...Does it for them. You almost have to wonder who has the legs -- or jumpshot -- to carry the burden of their respective teams. We'll see."
"Did anyone see how Kobe just looked at Vujajic after he missed that wide-open jumper to end the 1st? Ha! That's what I'm saying."
"The one thing you've got to wonder about, watching Kobe defend Billups, is how much energy this will zap from Kobe. Especially now."
"The Lakers gave up a 14-2 run to end the half. As bad as Denver looked, its down just one. And I'm suppose to believe they'll stop LeBron?"
"After the game, join me on Facebook.com/vitaminwater to discuss. Direct link to the discussion: http://tinyurl.com/odc4x3"
"5:23 left....tied at 93. Absolutely Bogus foul call on Carmelo."
"4:01 left. Kobe's being too slow to attack. He'll need to attack quicker. Denver has too many athletes for Kobe to get away with that."
"Big-time trey by Kobe. But look at the exhaustion....similar to LeBron last night: looking for someone to create and can't find anyone."
"I don't know whether it's my TV or what, but I've never seen Kobe look this worn out. What about the 2 games in Denver, or the next round."
"Turnover by J.R. Smith. If Denver loses this game, these are the kind of mistakes that create questions about this team."
"A put back by Melo, then by Martin. Notice the trend? Where the hell are the Lakers' Frontline. Gasol? Odom? Ariza?"
"Trevor Ariza! What a turnover. It's all about the supporting cast. Game gets tight, and so does the backsides of certain players. As u can c"
"I smell overtime coming. Don't know why. I just do"
"Good play, but wrong man. Fisher's lost so much confidence. Now LA is in deep trouble. In their mind, they should be up 2-0. TROUBLE!!!"
"The game is over, join me on Facebook.com/vitaminwater to discuss. Direct link to the discussion: http://tinyurl.com/odc4x3"
"Needless to say Cleveland has got to win this game. They're not about to win Games 3 and 4. Mo Williams will be key, ofcourse. So with Big Z"
"Btw.....these are exactly the kind of games where Dwight Howard 4ort of disappears. No urgency. For some reason, he doesn't shoot enough."
"That can't happen tonight. He needs to attack. Big Z, Benny Wallace or  Anderson Varajao can't touch. He shot Average 30 this series."
"This is exactly why Orlando is so dangerous. With Cleveland up 43-20, Orlando is on a 9-2 run, with J.J. Redick popping 3's. Keep watching"
"LeBron's a manchild. If he ever develops a consistent perimeter game, he will go down as THE GREATEST OFFENSIVE PLAYER IN NBA HISTORY."
"Reminder everybody! Get involved in vitamin water's Great Debate: LeBron vs. Kobe. You've seen them both. Especially in these playoffs."
"Who do you want on your squad right now. Who's the man? Who's going to get it done? Let's rap about it later"
"Cleveland's gotten careless and lax on offense, with Big Z throwing up bricks. Meanwhile, Orlando's jumpers are falling. LeBron will have to"
"...........Take over. He'll succeed and the Cavs will win. But what about the confidence Orlando gains from yet another comeback??? Trouble!"
"Absolutely bogus call vs. Courtney Lee. Don't care if Ben Wallace was outside the restricted area. And BTW...Van Gundy should play Lee more"
"No wonder there's a great debate. It is absolutely shocking to me LeBron has to do everything, just like Kobe"
"I'll take it back. Jumpers by Williams. Big Z diving on the floor for loose balls. Cleveland is trying, at least"
"Uh Oh! Last minute at LeBron gives up a 3 to Turkoglu w/ a missed assignment, then travels on the ensuing possession. It's on King James now"
"Oooooohhhhhh Mmmmyyyyy God!"
"LeBron did. Saved the series, Period.
I'll be talking to everyone on facebook.com/vitaminwater in a few hours. There's a lot to talk about"
"We Are All Witnesses!!,"
"1 more thing: LeBron was covered on that last shot, but he found a way to TAKE that last shot. Kobe should've done the same. Not Fisher"
"Kobe or Lebron? Join me at vitaminwater's The Great Debate on Facebook here http://tinyurl.com/qz3po4"
"Initially, I wanted to wait until the 4th Qt to tweet, but the Lakers are killing. Four times Andrew Bynum is in the paint trying to score.."
"...And all I'm thinking is: How about getting Pau Gasol the ball? Clearly, Bynum isn't ready. No one's creating space for Kobe, Come on!!!"
"A Sasha Vujacic sighting. Thank God!"
"If you're Denver you can't have an inexperienced guy like J.R. Smith on Kobe at a time like this"
"Btw...my sister Arlyne, who knows nothing about Basketball, is calling to tell me there's no way LeBron is better than Kobe. Hard to argue"
"Kenyon Martin giving guarantees, then going out and scoring 6 pts before fouling out. He might want to Shut up now"
"From now until the end of this campaign just click here:  http://tinyurl.com/qz3po4 to catch me talking about vitaminwater's Great Debate"
"Kobe hit 15 of 17 FT's. Big three as the game waned. That's what makes choosing b/t him and LeBron so hard. Kobe's still the ultimate closer"
"I'm about to do an interview on MadDog Radio right now. Check it out on Sirius"
"And for those who missed my interview on MadDog Sirius Satellite Radio, I'll have it posted in the Audio Gallery on my website later today"
"Based on everything I've seen in these conference Finals, I can't wait to see what LeBron pulls off next and whether he'll one-up Kobe. But."
"If Cleveland struggles as much in Game 3 as they did in Games 1 and 2, Orlando still controls this series."
"Don't want to venture too far away from vitaminwater's Great Debate: LeBron vs. Kobe. But Dwight Howard has got to avoid foul trouble."
"Howard has got to avoid cheap fouls and Van Gundy needs to get him more involved. He's got Ilgauskaus on him, for crying out loud"
"LeBron missing J's and free throws. Varejao and ILgauskus fouling out. Dwight Howard MAKING free throws. How can u feel good about Cleveland"
"The real problem is Mo Williams.. It's bad enough he's undersized, but he's not making shots. LeBron has minimal help right now. It's Bad."
"Come discuss Kobe vs Lebron on vitainwater's Facebook page here http://tinyurl.com/qz3po4"
"<at>Drican7 Absolutely both teams can go down. We could very well have an Orlando/Denver Finals..with Melo and D-Howard as stars. But not yet."
"<at>Benjiegordon It's difficult to pinpoint with guys like that because he's in the game specifically to be physical and agitating."
"<at>Gunther_T Mo Williams has come up small...with 32 percent shooting. I like the fact he guaranteed victory in Game 4. Now he has to perform"
"<at>Itsyaboydward Because I can't dismiss LeBron and Kobe, that's why. Stars shine at moments like this, although I know both need help badly."
"BTW everybody.......I approve of Obama's choice, Sonia Sotomayor... For the Supreme Court. It's the right pick. I hope he gets 2 more picks"
"And this is coming from a guy who voted for Obama, but has not agree with a lot of what he's done. Oops! Let me shut up. Might get stalked:)"
"Btw...and for those on the Right who consider Sotomayor a radical pick. Now they know how the Left felt about Clarence Thomas"
"Things still looking tough for the Cavs. Magic really doing a good job closing out on their shooters. You can FEEL a run coming b/c of it"
"Btw.....LeBron has got to stop jacking up these three's. It's not helping. Actually, someone should attack Dwight Howard. Get him agitated."
"Howard has six techs during these playoffs, which should warrant a 1-game suspsension. Another tech definitely would. Desperate times......"
"Um, excuse folks, but Rafer Alston is BALLING. Six three's......and he was wide-open on the last one. How does than happen???"
"Now LeBron's missing free throws. In the 4th QT, no less. No wonder folks keep picking ""Kobe"" for the Great Debate: LeBron vs. Kobe"
"LeBron and Cleveland are doing the right thing by attacking the basket. But will they make free throws???"
"WOW!!!!! LeBron makes the 2 FT's with 0.5 left. Tell the truth? How many of you thought he'd make both? I damn-sure had my questions."
"<at>KevMiz You're right. Might've happened."
"<at>RickieavilesJr That's why I asked."
"<at>Tyler34uconn Can't knock that. But the game ain't over yet. And the airball he just shot doesn't help his case. He's settling for jumpshots"
"It's OVER!!!!!! The Orlando Magic are going to the NBA Finals. The Magic -- and Dwight Howard -- will close this out in Game 6"
"I'm on vitainwater's Facebook page right now. To debate Kobe vs. Lebron with me go here http://tinyurl.com/qz3po4"
"One thing I know for sure. If anyone wants to see LeBron and the Cavs called out, just watch Skip Bayless on 1st Take. He won't Disappoint."
"Huge Game for the Lakers. They've gotta win Game 5. If he doesn't, it's not about Kobe/LeBron anymore. It's about D-Howard and Billups, too."
"It's nice that Fisher and Bynum have decided to show up, but it's still tied at halftime. Kobe or Chauncey! Who ya picking to come through?"
"Nene should not have fouled out on that play. That should've been called on Gasol"
"Great pass by Kobe to Odom for the 3-pt play, passing up the wide-open 3. But what a damn shame that Gasol can't back down KM on the block"
"<at>kwsventures That sounds about right, actually. Cleveland and Denver should both win their next games, but that's it."
"<at>kwsventures That's why they've changed it to when/if you get too many there's an automatic suspension that ensues. That's more than $100.00"
"<at>six_nine_sports Tell you're wife to make sure she has a thing for HER HUSBAND. I'm tired of good fellas not getting enough love :)"
"<at>Jamie_singleton Game 5 was in LA. Do you really need to know anything else?"
"<at>DJsexyTIME11 I personally believe LeBron is leaving NO MATTER WHAT."
"<at>CharlieBrownKOS I know Pao is finesse. Nothing new. But you need to change your picture, bro. You look like Chris Brown. Not good right now"
"<at>Zayto822 Thank you. You know I love THE LOVE"
"<at>Brettthahitman I hope Cal is clean in all of this, but the NCAA is no joke. Cal's a winner in my book no matter what. But this is not good"
"<at>gogetter1 I love all of George Karl's press conferences. He's the master and saying stuff even when he's silent. Known him for years."
"<at>Killasam32 ESPN decided to move in a different direction. I respect their decision. Life's about moving forward, Bro. That's what I'm doing"
"<at>Nike30 I will definitely have another vitaminwater session tonight. It'll include Dwight Howard and Chauncey Billups. Plus I'm blogging"
"Ya know something: I'm watching Pres. Obama in California for his fundraising efforts, knowing how much their economy is suffering. And...."
"...I've come up with an idea for Gov. Schwarzenegger: How about raising taxes on the Entertainment Industry. Evidently, they have the $$$"
"Check out my latest blog post ""NBA Playoffs, Michael Vick, and more"" here http://stephena.com/?p=123"
"It's amazing how easy it looks for Orlando to score w/o LeBron in the game. But.....Mo Williams is hitting shots. So it might not matter"
"Vitaminwater needs to get ready to change their Great Debate to Dwight Howard vs. Kobe. This is over. Tonight or Game 6. It's over.Cavaliers"
"Unbelievable! Cleveland opens up the half trying to throw the ball into Big Z...knowing he can't handle Howard. The Cavs are tight. It's all"
"...On LeBron to take over. That's the only way they're winning this game"
"LeBron needs to stop with all those pull-up jumpers. Mo Williams is hot. Get him the ball. Plus, by doing so LeBron can conserve energy."
"Mike Brown finally has it right. His only hope is going small, using quickness not just to get off shots, but to defend perimeter shooters"
"How much more sensation can a player be, people? LeBron or Kobe? Ya'll still trying to say this is not a legitimate debate? Sensational show"
"<at>smits27 The TNT guys are probably right. No one can say a thing to my man Barkley right now. He called that Orlando would win this series."
"<at>kwsventures So what?"
"<at>"
"<at>truesportstalk Probably something to that D-Rose/Memphis situation. but who cares? He's in the pros now making millions. Cal is at Kentucky"
"<at>Gunther_T I think the Cavs are done. Officially tomorrow night. I don't believe they'll be a Game 7. Forget about the Finals."
"I'll admit....I'm SHOCKED! This is a dominating performance by the Lakers. Denver didn't show up at all. So much for Melo.."
"And ya know..I've been asked if Denver was the last team the NBA wanted in the Finals -- due to all their tattoos, etc., and the image issue"
"I actually may have given a touch of credibility to it if the game were close. But watching Kobe perform says it all. Statement game, folks!"
"<at>m1ntyi All Denver needs is another big man and an image makeover. They don't need everyone thinking they're a bunch of thugs."
"<at>Jharmrivers What up, J?"
"<at>bweeshoff Absolutely! Didn't think the Lakers would win until Sunday. Tells me something about them. CHAMPIONS!"
"<at>Makeupfaces. Chauncey's a winner. He'll be back."
"<at>Lewislloydfan Not true. They didn't respond to the challenge. They got outplayed. No conspiracy. They got beat."
"<at>doubleGmik Nothing...to me. I just posed the question because so many folks talked of how the NBA wouldn't want them b/c of appearances."
"<at>tyraLnotB I'm picking the Lakers to beat the Magic in 6 Games. Notice how I haven't even entertained Cleveland wnning Game 6 in Orlando!!!"
"Hey folks, I'm hanging in West Covina (Ca.) Watching my little nephew, Nicholas Brown, play little league baseball. He's good. Much, much..."
"Better than his uncle, that's for sure. My silly behind decided I'd grab a bat for the 1st time in 15 years and show the boys how it's done"
"Long story short....10 pitches, I flat-out missed 9 and foul-tipped once. Pathetic. Damn! What can I say. I'm sticking to Basketball."
"<at>Nany83 Yes, that bad. But I loved it. The kids had a blast and that's all that mattered to me. It's not like it was basketball, so I'm cool"
"<at>AndrewTheLion Thanks, my man. Much appreciated."
"<at>Kwsventures Got custom-made golf clubs. I look like Tiger Woods. Right up until the moment I swing. Then we find out what a joke I am :))"
"<at>BobaPower Tell me about it, Bro! Pathetic. But fun. A few days practice and I'd be fine."
"<at>Flaav Whatever you say. As long as it means ""I suck"" you're right on target."
"<at>Worxism I'm an East Coast Guy. No denying that. But I must admit, the more I'm in Cali, the more I'm lovin it. Seriously!"
"<at>DJsexyTime11 Lakers in 6. Possibly 5."
"<at>Jah_rome Nah! I was at Del Norte, I think."
"<at>CHOSEN Haaaa!!! What can I say."
"<at>perfection91 I'm predicting the Magic, running away in the fourth quarter. But I want to be wrong sooo bad. LeBron and Kobe final..my wish"
"<at>Elgindotcom Duncan, KG, Stoudamire, Nowitzki, Bosh. So to answer your question: Top-5? Hell No!!!"
"<at>Elgindotcom And I forgot about Pau Gasol"
"<at>FanIQ Now you tell me :)"
"<at>apolonia_milan I'll try not to. Love the advice, btw. Nothing better than a woman who loves taking care of men :)"
"<at>CodyP3 Whatever you say, Sir! When you're point matters, I'll be sure to let you know. But I love the fact that you're tuning in. Touching"
"<at>itimmyB It's sad, but it's reality. Perception is reality. You're selling a product to a majority of white folks, their comfort matters."
"<at>yankeesgod2622 Not hating Melo. He's a bad boy. Just stating fact. Stop being sensitive. You're not a psychologist. Calm down!"
"<at>Perfection91 Yes! Despite what the Magic are doing, I think the Lakers will take them. They're on a mission. LA's time is now. Or never."
"<at>Liba77 You can't ignore that LA lost to Orlando this season, but this would be the Finals. Can't see Kobe losing AGAIN. Would be very bad."
"<at>doubleGmik Black people -- Listen. Brothers with a bunch of tatoos are a turnoff for White America. A gangsta look makes leagues nervous."
"<at>doubleGmik Period. It's just the truth. You can't ask people to patronize your product if you don't want to pay attention to what matters.."
"<at>doubleGmik ...to them. That's the way life is. We're so busy focusing on what's right and wrong. Where does that get us? Conformity is the."
"<at>dougleGmik...the name of the game. Always has been. Always will be. It's never changed, so why even bother debating it?"
"<at>morganCHRIS Thanks for the laugh. That's the funniest thing I've heard all weekend."
"<at>DJGRANDMAN Exploring new ventures. Who knows what the future holds."
"<at>sevsarkissian LA."
"Thank God Wally is in the last year of his deal. He's done nothing. And too bad Williams keeps waiting forever to show up. Poor LeBron."
"I think vitaminwater kind of screwed up. We sat around talking No. 24 vs. No. 23. Somebody forgot to mention Superman, wearing No. 12"
"Dwight Howard is officially the game's most dominant big man. Imagine what he'll be like when he REALLY learns to play in the post."
"Orlando's win is well deserved. But I'm still not picking them to beat the Lakers, even if they won both games this year. Kobe..now or never"
"And btw...one of the keys to this series will be Trevor Ariza. Remember, the Magic gave him up for Brian Cook. May come back to haunt them."
"Wanted to take a moment to thank everybody who's following me on twitter. Had no idea I'd have so many followers when this began 6 weeks ago"
"It's not the amount of followers Kim Kardashian has, ofcourse. But I don't look nearly as good as her, so there's no surprise there :)"

"<at>phillysjewel You're right. I didn't pick them and I should've due to their size advantage in their backcourt. I respect them, though."
"<at>jmo310 LA in six."
"<at>KB4MVP Thanks my man. Appreciate the love."
"<at>KB4MVP I'm thinking positive, my man. I'm find with their decision because I wanted to much more than they wanted me to do. It's cool."
"<at>Phillysjewel No! Not after Jameer Nelson went down with his injury. Didn't see it, but they've earned my respect. No matter what happens."
"Just finished watching Pres. Obama's Speech in Cairo. Major kudos for, first, having the guts to make this speech. Very substantive. But...."
"I'm wondering if he'll really accomplish anything. Obama's a pragmatist. We all know in the Arab world, spiritual beliefs trumps pragmatism"

"<at>morganCHRIS I believe Dwight Howard -- the man with the hilarious vitaminwater commercial -- is good for 30/20 and 4 tonight. Won't matter"
"<at>kuhlmad The free agent who can make the biggest impact is Ron Artest. But that all depends on where he lands. In LA? They win it all again."

"Btw......didn't I tell ya'll Rafer Alston wouldn't make perimeter shots in LA!!! He's not a shooter. He's streaky, and better at home."
"Things are getting very interesting. Knew Turkoglu would get off a little, but didn't think Orlando would have a lead after 3. Hmmmmmmm!!!"
"Rashard Lewis is a 2nd-and-4th-Qt guy. He ends halves and games for Orlando, coming on strong now. But Odom will answer, just like I told ya"
"WOW!!!!!!!!!"
"Great play by Turkoglu, faking out Odom like that with the step-back 3. But what I don't understand is why Odom goes for that fake? Makes..."
"After the game, join me on USTREAM to discuss Game 2. http://bit.ly/ApEij"
"No sense. If you're Odom, why do you care if he's driving to the basket. Let'em. Orlando's a threat from beyond the arc. Not on drives"
"Kobe fault: Time is winding down and Lamar Odom is WIDE OPEN in left-corner. He should've fed Odom instead of taking the contested shot"
"Great finak-play call by Van Gundy. No communication b/t Ariza and Kobe on the pick that freed Lee for the Alley-oop. Bad sign for LA."
"Wide-open miss from the key by J.J. Redick. If he can't make that he doesn't belong in the game. He serves no other purpose."
"Great pass by Bryant; great finish by Gasol. But what I'm loving most is Gasol and especially Odom's perimeter defense on Lewis. That's key"
"i'm live on USTREAM answering questions! Join me! http://bit.ly/ApEij"
"<at>TAdeyemi ESPN didn't want me anymore. It's as simple as that. I mentioned it in a blog on my website weeks ago...StephenA.com. Check it out"
"<at>WesNes Because Orlando is pretty damn good. Especially when they're hitting those 3's."
"<at>thespecial123c Yep! Unless he's willing to accept considerably less money."
"<at>one66soul Dwight has to watch those turnovers, but it still doesn't take away from all those open shooters he kept finding. He did good."
"<at>Ace_A Then you still don't doubt me because I picked Orlando for Game 3."
"<at>KeefBoyd If I were Van Gundy I'd probably consider starting Nelson for Game 3. If you're not concerned about anything. If so, its Alston"
"On a non-sports-related matter, folks need to read Syndicated Columnist, Stanley Crouch' latest column on fanatics. He's right on point."
"Also....don't know how interested folks are in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, but Mortimer Zuckerman makes a strong case for Israel."
"<at>joserchaps9 No! They're not done. Not until Game 4. They'll win Game 3. Game 4 will decide if this is a series."
"<at>Genuinman Thanks, my man. Appreciate the love."
"<at>MoneyMakinBeezy Thanks my man. Reach out to Skip and tell him I said ""what up!"""
"<at>Solefob Not true if Hamas is the real power in Palestine and they're not satisfied with anything but Israel's obliteration."
"<at>CH1chi You're ignorance if just too much to take any longer. You're officially cut off."
"<at>GordonFisherman Amen, Brother! Amen."
"<at>Nathaniel_Smith I agree...but only if the Palestinians honor whatever accord is reached and stops the violence.Can't negotiate with killers"
"<at>Crystal_ESPN I'm doing well, Babygirl. Hope the World-Wide Leader is treating you well. Take care of yourself."
"<at>therealbenh Why on earth do you think me -- of all people -- would make a good diplomat. Don't believe I have a diplomatic bone in my body"
"<at>mistajayyy I agree with Zuckerman's point. But I know that isn't all there is to it. But it's difficult to side with suicide bombers. Sorry"
"imsoharlembitch Yeah! I feel you. But that doesn't mean we ignore when he's making a good, honest point. Hatred shouldn't make you blind."
"Damn ya'll. Life sucks some times. I grind my teeth at night at times. Stress, I guess. And because of it, I cracked 2 fillings."
"On the way to the damn Dentist. I'm telling you, a Dentist can make a wus out of the World's Strongest Man. Damn!!!"
"<at>christopherwink Some of us have, but the Daily News has some great reporters. Mike Kern. Phil Jasner. John Smallwood (my friend)."
"<at>jemelehill Love ya, Girl! So proud of you. Saw you on SportsReporters the other day. Tell everyone I sent my best. Keep doing your thing."
"<at>Morganchris Nothing funny about that damn Dentist, man. Not a damn thing funny."
"<at>Gregory_adams Philly desperately needed a shooter. If Elton Brand does what he's suppose to do, they can really make some noise."
"<at>GokeyBell It did. I'm cool. Sounding like Elmer Fudd, but I'm cool :)"
"<at>Tach1 My next gig is coming soon, I believe. Aside from that, I'm starting my own Podcast on my website within an hour. Check it out."
"Changed my mind: I'll start my Podcast on my website tomorrow, recapping Game 3 tonight. I'll be in Orlando for Game 4, too."
"Just listened to Mark Jackson on ABC and he's absolutely right about Rafer Alston. He's placing loose, attacking, like he's suppose to do."
"The way things look, though, it might not matter. Kobe looks unstoppable. This could be a sweep. So much for the Great Debate. Kobe! Kobe!"
"Join me on USTREAM at the half. I'll be answering questions. http://bit.ly/ApEij"
"Ya know....I'm convinced now I need to listen to Ludacris. He keeps telling me we're definitely related -- now everyone else keeps saying it"
"I may need to get someone please do some research on this. Ludacris introduced me to his Mom at the White House Correspondents dinner and..."
"Asked her this. It's time I start listening :-)"
"<at>TheWheeler717 Thanks a lot, my man. I like talking to those guys. I'd actually live in Atlanta. But, honestly, it would be too difficult"
"Atlanta is my personal Sodom and Gomorrah. I'm trying to live better people. Can't expose myself to too much of that temptation."
"<at>MoneyMakinBeezy Skip and I hosted PTI years ago, my man. We blew up the spot. But it never happened again. Can't speak on why it didn't."
"Join me on USTREAM tonight for the NBA Finals. Come ask me a question! http://bit.ly/ApEij"
"Good Lord! En route to Orlando and my flight's already been delayed 2 hours. I'll be lucky to make the Game. Pox on all these damn airlines"
"Since I'll be at the game tonight I actually won't be on USTREAM tonight. But you can catch my tweets during the game."
"5:05 pm. Still stuck on the runway. May not make the game in time. In 1st class, and still no food is being served. Damn Shame!!!!!!!"
"I just finished standing talking to all of my boys at ESPN.. Nobody's confident in what they're seeing right now, not even MAGIC!!!!"
"Lakers just look fatigued right now. Like they're in desperate need of this 2-day break following Game 4. As usual, Odom is giving nothing"
"Lakers have come back but they need to be careful. Gasol has got to go strong to the hole. They can't leave this one up to Kobe"
"Magic told me before halftime he was scared Kobe may be too tired. Someone else has got to step up. BTW......"
"Chris Brown and Rihanna were both here at the club in the Arena. I wish them both the best.
Plaxico Burress was here, too. And  Tiger Woods"
"And Edgerrin James, who'd love to be a Philadelphia Eagle, btw...And my man Al Harrington of the Knicks. They've got to keep him, btw."
"Pathetic turnover by Fisher. Farmar needs to be in this game. And I know Gasol has 4 fouls -- and Dwight gets his vitmains -- but damn!!!"
"A little defense would be nice. Howard's starting to get aggressive at just the right time. Gasol has no chance if he can't match that fire"
"Btw......I saw Lil Wayne, too. Thanked him for the love he's shown me in putting me on several of his songs. That's true respect. Seriously!"
"Big-time three by Trevor Ariza (2:35)."
"But damn!!!! Same for Hedo.
Then a big-time block by D-Howard......then another short-J from Hedo. Orlando is going to have to pay him"
"How about Howard has 9 blocks"
"The ENTIRE LAKERS' TEAM: 2"
"Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fisher for 333333333333333!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But there's still too much time on the clock for Orlando"
"Damnit, Lamar. Rashard Lewis was Wide Open. Lucky Hedo called timeout"
"I'm still with the Lakers, Big Fella."
"Love D-Howard. But he's really messin up with these free throws."
"Another big-time 3 by Fisher. Wow! Then I think he was staring at my man, Mark Jackson.. 31.3 second left. This is the series, ya'll"
"Like I said......PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!"
"It was great hanging with Al Harrington, Charles Barkley and a whole bunch of my boys covering the NBA last night. But I'm getting old."
"<at>mkeltee There is no word on A.I.'s future. He's still trying to figure it out. He'll know a lot more within a month."
"<at>gregory_adams Don't know because I haven't seen any tapes of Rubio. But I can tell you that executives continue to salivate over him."
"<at>Jamal_Muhammad Ha...Ha...Ha...Chris Rock. Very funny."
"<at>TheBaseline I figured I'd tweet and let ya'll know what I was doing. If you don't want me to just let me know."
"<at>TherealestJg Appreciate the love, boss. Thanks a lot. Stay Tuned. Great things are on the way...I hope :)"
"<at>KevRodriguez No I didn't, but I wouldn't be surprised. Skip is acting crazy right now, especially about Kobe. But I love my brother. I do."
"Trip from Hell. Flying back from Orlando, Thunderstorms hovered over the East Region. So we spent 2 hours in a holding pattern, then got..."
"Re-routed to Wash. Dulles. Told we couldn't come back on if we got off. Waited an hour, then got off, had my cousin come get me to take me.."
"He took me to D.C., but not before we got stuck in another traffic jam. So I went from planning on being home by 2 pm to it being 6:30 and.."
"I'm still 3 hours away from home. And all of this b/c I went to Orlando to see what I knew would happen: A Lakers win in Game 4. Damn!!!"
"<at>dgirl48_ang If everyone looked like you, it wouldn't be :) But you're in Orlando, so you know what I'm saying. Take care."
"<at>mikachu02 Traffic was disastrous. My Saturday was ruined. But I'm cool. Worse things in life could've happened."
"<at>MsVirgoCree Yes Maam!"
"<at>REAL_SHAMS_94 I try to be."
"<at>dymdropper23 Nope! I see the Lakers losing Game 5, then going back to LA and closing it out in Game 6."
"<at>Holleymvp I am grateful. What is wrong with you people. I've got to be grateful because I'm complaining about delays at an airport? WTF..."
"<at>AlmaLaCubana Forget about me and fun. Judging by your photo, you look like you have more fun than all of us combined :)"
"<at>Showtime_Bx No worries. It's coming. For now, though, I'm just doing my podcast right here on my website. Warming up for what's coming :)"
"Just finished watching the Cotto/Clottey fight. Clottey was stronger, crisper and better defensively. And I STILL give Cotto the fight."
"Thing is, I don't blame Clottey for being upset. Either man could've won the fight, but I would not have had a problem with a DRAW!!!"
"Game 5 is about to arrive, and I'm listening to everyone talk about how the Magic are done. I DISAGREE. Orlando will win.......TONIGHT!!!"
"Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu or BOTH need to have a big game for the Magic to win this game"
"One more bad decision from Rafer Alston is gonna get him benched."
"And Btw.....my boy, Chris Broussard is absolutely correct: The Cavs are pursuing SHAQUILLE O'NEAL."
"Fyi...folks: I'll be streamed on USTREAM talking to my folks on Twitter at halftime AND after the game. I'm doing a post-game Podcast, too"
"<at>forevermobley Just go to Ustream.com and you should be able to find me. Essentially, you're tweeting and i'm answering them verbally."
"<at>Hoopzfan I believe Joe D will go after Carlos Boozer. If he can't get him, he'll wait until Bosh is available and go for that."
"OMG...The Lakers look like they're gonna run them outta here TONIGHT. To Hell with Tuesday."
"<at>LaBradfordR We agree on that, my man. Shaq will definitely get a title next year if he goes to Cleveland, further cementing his legacy."
"My Podcast will be on my website about an hour after the game. At least that's my plan."
"Come join me on USTREAM! I'm answering questions live! http://bit.ly/ApEij"
"See, here's the thing: Champions respond defensively no matter how they're struggling offensively. The Magic look lost when they can't score"
"J.J. Redick actually passed up a wide-open 3-pointer. Why IN THE HELL IS HE IN THE GAME."
"Sorry! I was wrong about Game 5. Really though Orlando would show up. Didn't think they'd be this FLAT. Kobe easily the MVP."
"Before any of you bring it up...YES!!! I noticed Kobe jumping up in the air and pumping his fist just like JORDAN did in 1998"
"OMG.......Dr. Buss' son was a TERRIBLE interview. Who the hell thought to have him speak for the team???"
"I'm about to Stream on USTREAM in 5 minutes"
"FYI...just put up my Podcast on my website: StephenA.Com. Enjoy."
"<at>GokeyBell Thank you, Dear. Glad you liked it."
"<at>crazylegs225 Never pay attention to it. Got better things to do with my time. But they can feel free to enjoy themselves. It's all good."
"<at>TheRealBigTukes Doubt it."
"<at>DonnieHoward Just check out my Podcast at StephenA.Com, my man."
"<at>Ftingue I've said it before and I'll say it again: I firmly believe LeBron James is coming to New York. I stand by it. Won't change my mind"
"<at>NYG26 No Sir! That part of my life is over. I'm not with ESPN any longer. No need for me to be at the Draft. I wish them well."
"<at>Kelzzzflo That's the way it goes, my man. No hard feelings. It is what it is."
"<at>Supernola1 I left ESPN on May 1. If you checked my website, StephenA.com, it's all there. Even wrote a blog about it."
"BTW everyone....I'll be on the Steve Harvey Morning Show tomorrow, doing the Strawberry Letter. I'll be doing the entire show on June 26th."
"Correction: I'll be on the Steve Harvey Morning Show TODAY...Tuesday morning, doing the Strawberry Letter."
"If you missed it, you can check out my latest podcast here on the Lakers championship. http://stephena.com/?p=156"

"<at>Derekfisher Congrats, D-Fish. Great job. Take care."
"<at>Keithfree I think Pacquaio will eat him up. Too fast. Too quick. Plus Cotto's been bleeding too easily and looks slower. Easy fight for Pac"
"<at>Peoplegogy doing my own thing and working on exactly that, my man. I don't plan on going away. Trust!"
"<at>Nice_24 I'm asking myself the same question, Nick. I just told some dude name Chris who emailed me I'm blogging and Podcasting about it"
"<at>MoneyMakinBeezy No need to dignify that would a response because there's no way in hell Kobe is getting 3 more rings."
"<at>andyhorst3 I deeply appreciate Lil Wayne showing me that kind of love, using me in his song. Didn't  know he did it, but it shows love."
"<at>celtsfan33 I'm working on the intro music, my man. Should have it by next week at the latest."
"<at>Midou24 If they want me, I'll do it. ESPN will always be family to me. Especially Skip Bayless. Whenever he needs me, I'll be there."
"<at>Mita2009 Appreciate the love, my dear. Keep tuning it. I'll do one on sports every other day...and one on Politics two days a week."
"<at>DonnieHoward I'll one a Podcast posted TONIGHT. Talking Stallworth, Vick, Favre, Shaq and whatever else is on my mind. 1 on Politics? a Day"
"In Atlanta today. Sticky as hell"
"All-Star Comedy Jam with Cedrick The Entertainment on Showtime. I'm watching right now."
"<at>Kobethegod Arie Spears is my man. That dude is hilarious. Should get much more props than he's received."
"<at>TDFinn I can believe that."
"<at>nnala15 He's definitely one of the greatest. But I have to think about that. Thought he lost one of those fights to Morales. He's top-20"
"<at>DCCocktailsExam Don't know yet. But It'll be tonight. I'm going out somewhere, that's for sure."
"<at>MrNateJones Family, dawg!"
"<at>mdog70 Oh, Hell No! Not today. But possibly tomorrow, unfortunately. Business is Business. Impressions need to be made."
"<at>Purplediva13 Thank  ya, Love! Always appreciate being welcomed to the  ATL."
"<at>brihea99 No worries. I don't stay in Sodom and Gomorrah for more than 72 hours at a time anyway :)"
"<at>RavenMadd I plan to, my brother. Appreciate the looking out."
"<at>MsVirgoCree Thanks for the compliment, my dear :)"
"<at>keithfree That my be true, my man. Cotto looked slow and sluggish. And he's bleeding too easily now. Pacquaio will take him."
"<at>Melosmooth2324 Thank ya!!!"
"<at>theprince522 Family, Dawg!"
"<at>therealbenpete Family, Dawg!"
"<at>credden Family, my man. And yes, this is Sodom and Gomorroh. Too many fine honies in Atlanta. That's why I stay inside...to behave myself:)"
"<at>keithfree Paul Williams is a bad match for any of those Welterweight dudes. He's just entirely too tall and throws too many punches."
"<at>AlmaLaCubana Stop rubbing it in. Arizona will be a legitimate desert in a few days, tops."
"<at>Farrah1228 Appreciate the love. In Atlanta with Family. Just hanging before heading to Dallas for Steve Harvey this weekend."

"<at>ShypsiCreative Thanks. Appreciate the love."
"<at>MORGANchris You need EVERYTHING! The Kings are God-awful. I truly wish them luck because I'm a fan of the Maloof Brothers. Damn Shame"
"<at>Bigspender421 Sad how little you've learned about me over the years. Homer? That's Funny! But you won't be laughing in a year."
"<at>RoyG101 ESPN wanted to move in a different directions rather than allow me to explore other things. I respect their decision. It's over."
"<at>3Supreme Appreciate it. G.A. left for the same reason. Michael Irvin? You'd have to ask him."
"<at>LadyaDavis I'm leaving for Dallas right now. But I'll probably be back next week. What's up???"

"<at>Sharazoid Yes Maam! I can tell."

"<at>cherri307 Always lovely seeing another WSSU Grad. Special love for ya."

"<at>conceptual23 I can't imagine what RUMORS are going on. But it's a fact I departed from ESPN on May 1. That I'm exploring new opportunities"
"<at>MrSamBoogie Don't even know what that is, Bro! Just know I have a twitter account and I try to tweet every day. That's all I know."

"<at>officeryorly Thank you, sir! Always appreciate the support."
"<at>Illtown973 Here's all I can tell you: the Knicks definitely want Stephen Curry, but don't know if he'll fall that low. Portland wants Shaq"
"<at>codygipson The Cubs will be in the postseason. I love Lou Pinella. As for the Yankees,they'll be there, too. But Boston is just better."
"<at>Akhoury5 Celts won't need to make a deal. They're plan is to grab Donte Jones from the Nuggets and make sure KG returns 100 percent healthy"
"<at>Mrclutchh The Hawks won't do any better than they did this year unless they get who they want: Amare Stoudamire. They're after him."
"<at>duce_is_wild I appreciate all the love, but here's the thing: Everyone keeps saying they missed Quite Frankly, but that's been off the air."
"Quite Frankly has been off the air since Jan. 2007. Again, the love is appreciated, but if more people SHOWED SUPPORT, it might still be on."
"That's an issue with us, meaning Black Folks: We love a lot of things but don't take enough time to DISPLAY our support. Then when it's gone"
"We complain. Think of the shows that would still be on the air today if we were vocal and active in our support. But we never do it. A Shame"
"Let me be clear: I'm not talking about my show, in particular. I'm talking about the issue of overall Black Support. It's one thing......."
"...for Quite Frankly to be off the air. It's another thing, entirely, for folks to STILL come up to me talking about how much they LOVE my.."
"Show -- as if it's still on the air. It hasn't been for nearly 2 years, which means folks haven't been paying attention. That doesn't happen"
"...with other ethnic groups. Period. All I'm saying is that we have to do a much better job of VISIBLY DISPLAYING our support for another"
"Word of mouth is not good enough. You've got to write it, verbalize, speak out and make sure the networks KNOW you're behind something."
"That's what happens with every other ethnic group, so why not ours? Again, this is not about QF. It's about a bigger issue:"
"Black folks not doing a better job of supporting what we claim to love. Notice, I didn't say YA'LL. I said US. Me included. We can do better"
"It is a touchy issue. And again, I'm not talking about me. To hell with that. I accept responsibility for anything I may have done wrong."
"But this is not about white people or anybody else. I'm talking about US as Black People. White America or anybody else, for that matter,"
"should NOT feel overly compelled to support US if we fail to support US. We couldn't disappear without a trace if WE were paying attention"
"But we don't. We take our own accomplishments for granted, literally appearing indifferent as if it's just another gig. Then when no one"
"else is on the air representing US, we blame the White Man. Except it's not their fault; it's ours. We didn't stand up and establish the"
"...significance of someone representing THE BLACK COMMUNITY. What they hell: Are they suppose to do it for US? We talk the talk but we don't"
"do enough. That's just a fact. And all I'm saying is, it needs to change. Make no mistake, I'm going to get mine. Don't care what anyone"
"...thinks. But in order for any Black person to carry that proverbial mantle, to make it clear who we're representing and how proud we are"
"...to do so, it would help a great deal if BLACK FOLKS being represented stood up and did something more than just yell your name in the..."
"...street as a show of support. The powers that be need to know that person matters and that the Black Community wants that person around..."
"Whites do it for Whites. Asians do it for Asians. Hispanics do it for Hispanics. US? Come on! We know we can do much more."

"<at>RoyG101 That's the plan, my man. It'll happen soon enough. But I'd prefer my own Radio Show first, personally."
"<at>brad_colbert What's so embarrassing?"
"<at>BlkCofy Folks are totally missing my point. I never said any of us should NOT want a diverse audience. I was just saying Blacks need to..."
"<at>BlkCofy ...vocalize their support for one another more when they legitimately feel that way. Not just rely on word of mouth. No one else..."
"<at>BlkCofy...does that. When you're a disenfranchised community, you've got to be more obvious in your support. Period."
"<at>bokeen My man, you're absolutely free to not follow me if you so choose. Go ahead and misconstrue my words. I was simply answering a ???"

"<at>swagSetta I'm with you. I'm just praying someone like Stephen Curry will fall in their lap. The Knicks desperately need a bonafide shooter."

"<at>Birdsmoke Celts claim they're not moving Rondo and Memphis hasn't offered Gay. But if they do, the Celts will definitely change their mind."
"Alert! Alert! My sources tell me it's OFFICIAL: SHAQUILLE O'NEAL IS A CLEVELAND CAVALIER. LeBron officially has his best shot at a title."
"Damn! I can't believe Michael Jackson is dead. So sad. Unbelievable."
"Warriors just grabbed Stephen Curry. Do Not be surprised at all if the Knicks trade their pick -- plus Nate Robinson -- to GS for Curry."
"<at>suhailc Nothing! I'm afraid the Knicks are stuck with Hill, which tells me they're thinking they'll lose Lee, despite him being restricted."
"<at>GatorsRB85 Orlando got better, but they still didn't address their need of physical front-line help for Dwight Howard. Need to do more."
"<at>Stewnami It could mean that. Hedo, though, should want to stay even more. But Carter is certainly an insurance policy if he goes."
"FYI....Co-Hosting the Steve Harvey Morning Show RIGHT NOW!!!"
"<at>tikidiva_3 Stop it. You know better."
"<at>tikidiva_3 But OFCOURSE :)"
"<at>summerdreams3 Thank you, dear"
"<at>DSOHigh I know...I know. But Michael Jackson died. What can ya do, you know!"
"<at>Johnngalame Haaaa! Not really. No webcam in the studio."
"<at>ZIKEnyc I hear ya."
"<at>mikachu02 that's the album to have on blast, that's for sure."
"<at>GokeyBell Thanks a lot, Mari. Appreciate the love, as always."
"<at>slykingHot1077 Thanks a lot, my man."
"<at>Stevew32 Nope!"
"<at>PepeBean Ha! That's what they wanted. They're better off without me, I guess. I wish them well, my man. You should too."
"<at>AngelJulian Nice to know. Always in BMore. That's a good thing."
"<at>BigDaddyMoe8480 I just told them for you, bro. Don't be surprised if they're back in LA by the end of the Summer. Seriously!!!"
"<at>AlmaLaCubana My Podcast is online at StephenA.Com. I'm doing another one today or tomorrow."
"<at>Peoplegogy Can't see it happening. Spurs just grabbed R. Jefferson. They don't have enough to get Hedo, unless it's a trade."
"<at>Starx78 The Knicks don't need LJ? Bruh,no disrespect but you MUST be on drugs."
"<at>RoyG101 The T'Wolves took 2 PG's because they're a young team. Although the guards are young, too, a young team always needs pure PG""s."
"<at>jemelehill Thank you, sweety. Was great seeing you in Orlando last week."
"<at>MikeFrier He played in Europe. He's not subjected to the 19-year-old age limit because he playing professionally in Europe."
"<at>TreyfromYpsi Yep. And they'll get it, too."
"<at>mformley Thanks, babe."
"<at>DSOHigh Yes Sir. Absolutely."
"<at>tikidiva (Smile!!!!!!!)"
"<at>diesel2k1 Not true. The Lakers just need to keep their team in tact. Just like the Celts just need to get KG 100 percent."
"<at>KWAPT Dahntay Jones is looking for a multi-year deal. The Celts are willing to surrender $8 mil over 2 years. He wants 4 years."
"<at>E_Double I wanted the Knicks to get Stephen Curry badly. I'm very disappointed."
"<at>Najville I'm fully aware of the rule. I also know what Euro players would try to appeal b/c of the 1-yr removed from HS rule. Try again"
"<at>RoyG101 Don't necessarily disagree. Just telling you what their thought process was. It's the T'Wolves we're talking about, ya know."
"<at>BLKCofy Love the SHMS. Steve Harvey's doing his thing. Proud to be a part of the show, occassionally."
"<at>Kelzzzflo Anything's possible with Don Nelson, man."
"<at>Dmoney2231 Thanks, my man."
"<at>Misterbadmoon Appreciate the love, my man. Very nice of you to wish that. Seriously. I'd love to work with Charles and Kenny."
"Check out my latest podcast - NBA Draft Recap on iTunes and www.StephenA.com"
"I'm in Pittsburgh, ya'll. Just wanted to take a moment to congratulate my man, Garry D. Howard of the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel."
"A Sports Editor for the paper, he was also just named the first African-American President of the Associated Press Sports Editors."
"<at>RichJava That was suppose to be the case, until that damn Don Nelson decided he wanted to ruin everything by keeping Stephen Curry. Damnit!"
"<at>VPHDA He deserves it. Garry D. Howard is a good, real, straight-up Brutha! Gotta lot of love for that man."
"<at>domhoskins Are you talking about ME or Garry D. Howard."
"<at>humbleinc2009 Absolutely. And Vince may be one of the best Dunkers, but too bad he hasn't done more with his game. He should've been Kobe"
"<at>encore302 I do a Podcast practically every other day on my website, StephenA.com."
"<at>allen011374 Personally, I could give a damn about Soccer. Sorry."
"<at>Angelabriana We try our best :)"
"<at>Ftingue Hell No! The expectations for Vince were totally fair, considering his skill set. But you have to have the heart, hunger, with it."
"<at>E_Double Don't think it would be better than getting Curry, but it would still be very good. Certainly better than Hill for the Knicks."
"<at>Asynderman12191 Thanks. Enjoyed myself. Big-time Steelers fan since I was 5 years old. Also love Mike Tomlin and Big Ben."
"<at>Richjava True! Certainly can't argue with that in these economic times."
"<at>SeyArea It'll happen soon enough. I'm working on somethings. When things go down, everyone will know. Trust me."
"Joe Jackson is a damn DISGRACE. This man is promoting a new record company and his son, Michael, hasn't been dead for 2 days. DAMN DISGRACE"
"And I don't want to hear a single damn person complaining about the media's coverage of MJ. Complain about his disgrace of a father."
"<at>bgeustac YES!!! It most certainly is :)"
"<at>whahaa No! You're absolutely not wrong. Crappy parents don't necessarily equate to crappy kids. Although I wouldn't know. My Mom is GREAT"
"Just read a story about the White House reaching out to Ashton Kutcher to help get the word out about Nat'L HIV Testing Day. Good for them"
"<at>brandiray Damn embarrassing!"
"<at>ChicoBonds T'Wolves are swearing they're not about to let him go. That means Rubio is gonna have to return to Europe, or act like he will"
"<at>maja7th The man is damn pathetic. I'm suppose to be on MSNBC at 11:30 tomorrow morning and I'll be damned if I don't say just that."
"<at>SwinCash The man's a disgrace, Swin. He's the reason MJ was so messed up all these years."
"<at>fleetwood78 Not my call, my man. Those networks know where to find me if they want me. It's their call, not mine."
"<at>RobinsonReport Yes, actually. I AM a father. And there's no way in HELL I would ever be so classless and disgraceful."
"<at>ladyadavis Sorry, I never got an email from you. Go to my website and send it again. I promise I'll look for it tomorrow."
"<at>sportsspr1 Thank you soooo much. That's one of the greatest compliments I've ever received. I live to make my Momma proud, so thank you."
"Sorry to hear Michael Curry was fired as the Pistons head coach, but I'm not surprised. Joe Dumars had to do it. Players didn't want him."
"<at>erikgwilson Joe D has done more good than bad. Six-straight appearances in the conference finals, two-straight to the Finals, one title."
"<at>akapudge Can't argue with that, really."
"<at>TheAllenChen They did fire Iverson. Basically."
"<at>Oz3178 You're right on point with that, Oz. No doubt. Rip is not the one anyone should be messing with."
"<at>Kj1974 Why should Joe D's number be up? His job is to keep them competitive, which he has done. He's made some mistakes, but he's done well"
"<at>coach313 I think, considering all the changes Joe D has made, Laimbeer has earned the opportunity to show what he can do."
"<at>GiFTD1 Thank you. Much appreciated."
"<at>Fleetwood78 You know the answer to that question. No need to even touch that."
"<at>MidaZ I agree about Iverson. The problem is he hurt himself by speaking out in Detroit. He was in the last year of his deal. No need."
"<at>willie_lynch You're about three years late to the game, my man. Spoke out about this years ago. I'm opposed to the zone in pro sports."
"New podcast on www.StephenA.com - Michael Jackson and NBA Free Agency News"
"<at>KimKardashian I'm a fan...and a follower. Please tell Reggie I sent my best."
"<at>HipHollywood Why am I not surprised, Mr. Frazier. Handle your business."
"<at>Babyjesus2232 Appreciate the kind words. Thank you."
"<at>bgsportsfan12 Not to the Pistons. But anything else is possible right now. Especially where Rondo is concerned if Memphis moves Gay."
"<at>JKH_GA I assume you're talking about my hit with JT The Brick? Thanks."
"<at>Fleetwood78 Who does!"
"<at>Peoplegogy Not much. But it keeps the Pistons respectable and positions them within one player from championship contention again."
"<at>abenn31 Not coming back. ESPN decided to move on, and so have I. Wish us both luck."
"<at>Mslovely41 Thank you so much. Always appreciate it when I get love for my response to Strawberry Letters."
"<at>Aziatictag Appreciate the love for my Podcast. Thank ya much for the support."
"<at>Gauthia2 We'll see soon enough."
"<at>Dacoach34 Not a damn thing, bro! Sorry."
"<at>ChicoBonds Ofcourse. There's always something. But I'll always listen to MSG. A few of my boys are there."
"<at>VergeFringe Thanks a lot. The man's a disgrace. He's the reason MJ never grew up, in all likelihood."
"<at>DerikP Thank you, sir. Appreciate the kind words."
"<at>Pastormonty Thanks, my man. You will soon enough. I plan on surprising quite a few people in the very near future."
"<at>Ryshan15 LeBron would run down Sunset Blvd butt naked and kiss Perez Hilton on the lips before joining the LA Clippers. Trust me!"
"<at>MisterBadMoon He's worth the money. He's a closer."
"<at>burnone27 Yes Sir! It'll be tough, but they can pull it off. We'll see. Very entertaining free agency thus far."
"<at>Misterjpmanahan KWAME Brown is still around. You can't get any closer to Rasho Nesterovic than that."
"<at>Metalgear7 Yes I do. Thank you very much. My sister worked there at the time. That's why I did it."
"<at>AwesomeHill1 I'm living life, my man. But appreciate you thinking of me. Thank you."
"<at>RayacH Thanks, my man. I've been a contributor to Steve Harvey's Show for 2 years now. Love every moment of it. Appreciate the love."
"<at>TLove81 That's an ignorant thing to say. Rajon Rondo is one of the top-3 PG's in the Eastern Conference. He's not great, but he's good."
"<at>MetalGear7 Who are you talking about?"
"<at>Jankeyone I have a Podcast and blogs on my website: StephenA.com. That's where you can catch me always. But I have somethings coming up."
"<at>Sharazoid It's inappropriate for anyone to speculate right now. Especially since another woman was killed with him and it wasn't his wife."
"<at>CamBrodeur Appreciate the love. Always."
"<at>Kwsventures If the Rockets do that, they're telling the city of Houston they've given up on next season."
"<at>BrianSida I'd say Cleveland. But if Boston gets Rasheed Wallace, they're clearly the team to be next season."
"<at>SJACK2016 It's possible. But I personally believe LA, Orlando and ESPECIALLY Boston have a better shot. The Celts really impressed him."
"<at>KojaK2k3 I think D-Wade will either stay in Miami or head to NY with LeBron. Just a thought."
"<at>fefe_T Yes! But I'm a Daddy now, so my priorities have changed drastically. I so love being a Daddy, nothing else matters to me right now."
"<at>bignitti Departed from ESPN May 1st. Their decision; not mine. But I still love all of those guys. Hope to be back someday at right moment."
"<at>kwsventures Hedo's proved he's no winner. Left millions and title contention for millions and mediocrity. He deserves what he gets."
"<at>smashedhalo What are you talking about?"
"<at>shaluv7 Appreciate the love. Thank ya!"
"<at>DenBronco26 Not good! You prompted a franchise QB to leave before ever coaching the kid a down. And ownership let him get away with it. SAD"
"<at>theruff713 I plan on doing a Podcast today. I'll make sure to talk about Artest and Ariza and Rasheed Wallace, too."
"Fyi......Rasheed Wallace is Heading to Boston. The Celtics are officially the favorites for the NBA Crown."

"<at>cmonta Yeah! The most appropriate thing to say."
"<at>Khomatose Haaaa! What else can be said."
"<at>thezoner Not true, my man. If it were up to me, I'd rarely talk about race. But when I'm asked a question, I don't run. Simple."
"<at>jasonmorgannews Appreciate the love, Jason. Thanks a bunch"
"<at>jurisdiva Just trying to break it down in the best manner I can. Certainly don't want to excoriate him. But his father is pathetic."
"This is an ABSOLUTELY wonderful tribute to Michael Jackson. Very touching.....and very, very sad."
"Beautiful Speech by Rev. Al Sharpton. Entirely appropriate and, for the most part, on point. Glad he spoke instead of Jesse."
"Now they have me coming on HARDBALL on MSNBC in about 10 minutes. Looking forward to it, even though Chris Matthews is not hosting tonight"

"<at>Clovis1920 Boston vs. LA. But San Antonio could interrupt LA's plans."
"<at>nnala15 That's Doc Rivers call. What I can tell you, though, is that Rasheed Wallace doesn't care. He calls himself a senior citizen."

"<at>hail2skins They'll be fine, but they won't make much of a difference come playoff time. It's still about Boston, Cleveland and Orlando."

"<at>Fleetwood78 Nah! What did he say?"
"FYI....I will be on MSNBC tomorrow morning (Thursday) from 9 am to 10:30 am for a few segments. Feel free to tune in, please. Take care."
"<at>guatedad Everything comes in due time, bro. Coming back on MSNBC at 10 am. Appreciate the support."

"<at>MrLewis2 I have no idea. I'll check into it with my peeps. Thanks for the concern"
"<at>RockB321 I agree. But I also felt they should've re-signed Ariza. Bottom line: With Wallace in Boston, Bynum is LA's key for a repeat"

"<at>Supernola1 Yep! :-)"
"<at>cscoordinator When they call, I'll come."
"<at>jjc8116 Appreciate ya, my man."
"<at>jjc8116 No need to even say anymore, bro."
"<at>Rev_Robinson yes! I have new career aspirations. But if I can help it, I'll always be a part of the sports scene. ESPN? TNT? Even Better!!!"
"<at>ordinaryyou Amen!!!"
"<at>JasonakaDaddy Thanks my man"
"<at>ham1865 That's the most ridiculous shit I've ever heard. I'm a Black Man. Always living check to check. Don't let TV twist ya thinking."
"<at>Najville I'm sure I will. He's a former Mayor and Governor. Certainly knows more than me."
"Fyi.....Pres. Obama is giving a 25-minute speech to the NAACP tonight in the 7 O'Clock Hour. I will be on MSNBC'S HARDBALL immediately after"
"Fyi......will be on MSNBC'S ""Morning meeting"" with Dylan Ratigan from 9-to-11 am tomorrow morning. Hope ya'll will watch"
"You can check me out now until 11am on MSNBC'S ""Morning meeting"""
"Hope everyone plans on enjoying their weekend. I'm in Atlanta. About to be on CNN at 10:30 AM this morning. Holla at ya'll later today"
"Oops! I meant 10:30 TONIGHT. Sorry for the mix-up."

"<at>TheBaseline I hear ya, dawg! I'm try and listen to it."
"<at>Ninastylz3 I'm at ya."
"<at>memiles86er I left May 1st. No more debating Skip Bayless. I miss him. miss the network, too. But that's life. That's the way it goes."
"<at>joedisalvo Means a lot to me that you said that, my man. I'm hoping to be a part of the show for a very long time to come."
"<at>SuperflyG Appreciate the love, Boss!"
"<at>SwinZ9 Always trying to represent. That's all I know how to do."
"<at>Potato98 Funny you say that. A bunch of people have told me the same thing, yet they've never called."
"<at>cameronsnow Nope! Left May 1st."
"<at>SugarShaneM23 Nothing at all. They'll be decent, but far from Championship contention. This season. Then Bosh is leaving. End of story."
"<at>mrs406 Versatility is the key to a prosperous life, my dear. Especially in this day and time."
"<at>tedge36 doubt it. Miami's the place. Thing is, no one wants to touch Iverson right now. Folks are saying they're wondering where he fits in"
"<at>KyleAdriel appreciate the Respect, my man. Thanks"
"<at>CheeZMoto5 Probably never. ESPN parted ways with me on May 1st"
"<at>mola1 who the hell would want to hear that?"
"<at>yourboy123 Hard to say. Pat Riley is holding this one close to the vest. It's his call on Odom, though"
"<at>ham1865 I hear you, brother. Appreciate your thoughts"
"<at>krelwani sorry, Bro! We parted ways May 1st. My days at ESPN are over"
"<at>KevRodriguez Here's what we need: Pres. Obama to start drafting bills, READING THEM, and NOT relying on Pelosi and a bunch of Clintonites"
"FYI...Please go to StephenA.com, click on MEDIA, and go to my TV clips on Michael Jackson, HARDBALL on MSNBC and FoxNews.com' STRATEGY ROOM"

"We're about 50 minutes away from Pres. Obama's Press Conference on Healthcare, and a couple of thoughts come to mind:"
"1.) Will he really be able to sell this to America.
2.) Why do this w/o addressing Medicaid, Medicare,Social Security and Mal-practice  ..."
"....Not to mention the impact illegal immigration has on our system. I'm all for everybody having Healthcare. The question is: At what cost?"
"Pres. Obama's answer about Prof. Gates and Racial Profiling was PERFECT! Saying the Cambridge Police acted STUPIDLY was strong AND needed."
"<at>selmasDad Thanks."
"<at>leonmarbook I don't even know who Eric Maynor is. I DO know a Craig Maynor. He went to Winston-Salem State with me."
"<at>LBelton True! But they can do something about it if they address these MalPractice lawsuits, medicare, medicaid and illegal immigration."
"<at>LBelton We agree on that, my brother. It's pathetic. If I believed I'd have a shot at getting anything done, I'd run for office."
"<at>LBelton Especially in NY. The government situation in Albany is a flat-out atrocity. That's why I wanted to do WABC-RADIO so badly. They..."
"<at>LBelton ....lucky I'm not on the airwaves everyday. I'd start a damn movement. I'm serious. That nonsense is sickening."
"<at>seanhhills I'm inclined to agree with you, Bro! Seriously. Can't argue. Especially with all the money being spent. Inflation is on the way"
"<at>Stylz I think the people would love me because i'd be honest. But I wouldn't get anything done because those crooks don't care."
"<at>garn82 Not always! He's a little bit too careful sometimes. He's the President. Already elected. He could be a bit bolder sometimes."
"<at>garn82 But he was really, really good tonight."
"<at>MelvinJacksonll I hear ya, Melvin."
"<at>AmazingJayce :-)"
"<at>tishanderson Yep! But I sincerely hope we don't find out Prof. Gates escalated the situation by acting up BEFORE showing his ID."
"<at>jourdainracing Big Ben's not all over ESPN because it's an allegation from a year ago. Why should he be smeared based on allegations."
"<at>jourdainracing It's not fair. I'm all about holding anyone accountable, but it's not race to convict someone in public w/o court first."
"<at>Genske No sir! It would not have been smart for GATES to call the Cambridge Police ""Stupid."" I don't think the President needs to worry."
"<at>ordinaryyou Could not have said that better myself. Thanks for today's inspiration."
"<at>TheEbonyDoll Thanks for the invite. I hear Ok. City is very, very boring, though. At least the players feel that way."
"<at>MarkResendes My target number is 69. But I wouldn't put it past them to pull that off."
"<at>mikenorrod It's not sad at all. Considering the history of Police harassment across the broad, he can't be blamed for taking this position."
"<at>mikenorrod Also...remember he prefaced everything by saying Prof. Gates was a friend.  Someone he's known for years."
"<at>mikenorrod ..and like I said: If Prof. Gates reacted belligerently BEFORE showing ID, that's the only argument that works in the cops favor"
"<at>jourdainracing Simple answer: Who gives a damn about Matt Jones. Michael Vick and Randy Moss are more newsworthy. That's just a fact."
"<at>Chicobonds One would think. I know Sessions would like to come. I'm not sure he makes that much of a difference compared to Duhon, though."
"<at>Ahav05 Hell No! But Aaron Brooks is a damn good player. Better than Rafer, believe it or not. I like him. But I don't see much w/o T-Mac."
"<at>carlos2156 That's ridiculous. Being illegal means you're not registered in the system,...that there's many ways to circumvent the system"
"<at>Aasshhkkaann because I left May 1st"
"<at>kingkenley I left ESPN May 1st. It's over, people. Let it go!"
"<at>rnieves An unsubstantiated allegation that doesn't involve law enforcement shouldn't be reported. ESPN is right on this. It's a year old."
"<at>318Flyboy Thank ya!"
"<at>IAMWILL Because the woman is alleging it happened a year ago. That's the main reason I'm suspect about her"
"<at>Seanhills Obama has the right idea. The right heart. I'm just concerned about the $$$"
"<at>TheAllenChen I'm trying to, Bro! We'll see where it goes."
"<at>Dominicanboy2 LA or Miami. Probably LA....if he's smart."
"<at>ColbyB18 That's a damn-good question, Colby"
"<at>ATEAMNATION U break bad habits one day at a time, Bro! And you have to have incentive. For me, it's Fatherhood. It's changed my life."
"<at>garn82 Not much. I mean, I love Joe D grabbing Gordon and Charlie V. But it's not enough to compete with Boston, Cleveland and Orlando."
"<at>jbfunk How can you possibly say that. Tell me: what is free in this world? I hate the thought, too, but EVERYTHING has to be paid for."
"<at>kb242pac Here's the only thing I have to say about the Lakers: Maybe folks don't mind leaving b/c they suspect Kobe will leave next year :)"
"<at>FamousJonez That the dunk was completely overblown and mishandled. I really hope LeBron had nothing to do w/ NIKE withholding that video."
"<at>MarioHouston Probably! You're not news, Bro!"
"<at>MarioHouston....and I mean no disrespect, whatsoever, by saying that."
"<at>Ham1865 I believe that as a country, we'll prosper so long as our Economy is addressed and unemployment is not a problem. Healthcare cost$$"
"<at>bmoreheights Could be that, exactly. But if the President is your friend, there are ways to defuse a situation and get at him later"
"<at>Supernola1 Actually, No! I worked at ESPN for 5 1/2 years. There are plenty of things they didn't report that were suspect. Even about T.O."
"<at>kb242pac Nope. Boston's the favorite right now"
"<at>313Amare That's right. Sorry.
I DO like Blake Griffin, Flynn and Brandon Jennings, though. Jennings may be a steal for Milwaukee"
"<at>ChrsJordn Never! I'm better off raising HELL behind the Mic, in front of the camera and in Print. A bureaucracy wouldn't stop me."
"<at>Mic_Ezzi Gerald Green is running out of time. He's had plenty of time to make a difference"
"<at>Brianflowaz No interest in doing fantasy football. This year, bro. Sorry"
"Just say the video of ""Best I Ever Had"" by Hip-Hop artist DRAKE. The brother has skills. Just wanted to give him some luv for that."
"<at>risehoops The man deserves a second chance. He should be left alone to resume his career in the NFL."
"<at>ShawnJcomedy Amen!"
"<at>Mrs406 Hey! Hey!"
"<at>SportsAllDay83 Maybe he is. But that one particular song is something I liked. What can I say."
"<at>G520 How could I possibly forget that, Bro! :)"
"<at>bigbraz I've been grinding, Bro! But I'll have two within the next 48 hours. One on sports. The other on Politics."
"<at>mtownreppa Not at all."
"<at>Njfuture Soft? NEVER, Bro! Political? That's the plan. It's time to try and make a real difference. I'll never stop with the NBA, though"
"Damn! Damn! Damn! I was siding with Prof. Gates UNTIL I read this Police Report. If they're telling the truth, GATES WAS WRONG. Not the P.O."
"I'm about to appear on MSNBC on HardBall with Chris Matthews to discuss it at 7 pm. Damn Shame something like this has us focused on Racism"
"Okay...just got off the phone with Prof. Gates attorney, Charles Ogletree. He explained that Gates did, indeed, show his I.D. Much Better!"
"<at>cgrock24 Doesn't matter, CG! Do you have any idea how many times in my career I've sided with an athlete, only to hear them recant?"
"<at>donof Nope! But I do have a responsibility to report what they say and take it at face value until further evidence is provided."
"<at>the_hooch Appreciate the love, bro!"
"<at>mattitude23va Bottom line: Makes no sense to focus on it, my brother. U can't prove or legislate what's in someone's heart. Move past it."
"<at>J_roge Whites folks need to be honest, and Black folks need to allow that honesty to be expressed without retaliating emotionally. Simple."
"<at>1FAMUAN That's what I heard, as well. Plus, I don't believe he displayed a photo ID, but it's still unclear."
"<at>TheTwelve Sure! But the fact that it was said ON THE RECORD elevates the level of accountability. You now have a reference point."
"<at>mikenorrod People are flawed, but times have gotten better. Fact is, the  combo of an unbalanced power structure AND disenfranchisement..."
"<at>mikenorrod ...grates on the Black community. That feeling of being powerless in a society most feel is unfair irritates Blacks."
"<at>redeemedxgod True! But he's an officer of the law. A Black man's best recourse is to get the officer's information and stay quiet."
"<at>apolonia_milan Thank you, Dear. Much appreciated."
"<at>Ziglar55 I'm trying!"
"<at>CLMCll That would be one of many things the Mavs need. I love coach Rick Carlisle, and owner Mark Cuban. But they need to revamp. Period."
"<at>Ordinaryyou Couldn't agree with you more. Still, pay attention to the filth. It defines dirty. You'll always know how to remain clean."
"<at>Zeekness When the report quoted Prof. Gates saying: ""Do you know who I am?"" That screams authority and status to me. Never good for Blacks"
"<at>Illtown973 You may be right. But your pointing out that it may have been an Ego situation says it all. Gates has to be bigger than that."
"<at>Illtown973 He's the iconic figure within the Black community. The one honored by a former Pres., friends with Obama and Oprah. He knows..."
"<at>Illtown973 ...better. He's the educated scholar, remember? Plus, how many blacks do you know would've gotten away with his alleged behavior"
"<at>Illtown973 I'm not absolving the officer, but it doesn't sound like he was all wrong here. Bottom line: Gates didn't de-escalate situation."
"<at>Illtown973 That, in itself, is not good. And if there was another agenda going on, that's even worse. For Blacks, more than anyone else."
"<at>Mark_McPherson Not my call, bro! They made their decision to move forward; I respect their decision and I'm moving forward. Such is life."
"<at>millertime32 Always rooting for the truth, bro! But I also don't hide the fact that I always pray WE don't provoke precarious situations."
"<at>Millertime32 I'm not ANTI-anything. But I love my Black people and want us to do better than what we do sometimes. Can't apologize 4 that."
"<at>CarlaChappell Thank you so much for the kind words, Carla. Much appreciated."
"<at>miss_chukwu I have no idea. The only thing I'm sure of if that there will always be folks lined up to stop me. That is my life's story :)"
"<at>Aguilla112 Who are you talking about?"
"<at>Mark_McPherson Thanks Mark. I'm hoping a whole bunch of people feel that way. But again, I have NO DESIRE to leave sports. Just want more."
"<at>318Flyboy Haven't really watched the Summer league. Never waste my time with that. But Flynn, Curry, Griffin and Jennings are my favorites"
"<at>Irevere7 Thanks. Much appreciated."
"<at>Spikeaji I agree, but don't think they need to have a beer in the White House. It's over. Leave it alone. Too much spin control going on."
"<at>Stevilism Normally, you'd be correct. But that DOES apply when you're talking about an iconic figure who's a scholar, influencing others."
"<at>MisterBadMoon Say it if it's true, my brother."
"<at>Too_pretty08 Tonight. Promise."
"<at>313Amare Welcome to America, Bro!"
"<at>mikeiniowa12 yeah Man. That's the way it goes. People have jobs to keep, ya know. Who are any of us to judge?"
"<at>millertime32 Yes! But there are times when I feel it's my responsibility. That's just my conscience. I feel passionate about such things."
"<at>STTanner82 I personally believe he's bluffing. If Odom leaves, it's a clear sign to me that he suspects Kobe's gone next season."
"<at>QueDential3 I'll have a Podcast tonight. Promise."
"Just learned that Boxing champ Vernon Forrest was killed last night. I'm sick to my stomach. He was a good brother. A Damn Good brother."
"Taken away from us, reportedly, by BROTHERS!!! So many of us are so damn busy blaming White America for things. What about this BULLSHIT!!!"
"I AM SO DAMN SICK OF THIS!!! No one deserves this, but especially Vernon Forrest."

"<at>LaK7 I hear ya."

"<at>Ctinsley12 True! But that comes later. When you're black.....talking to black....it behooves you to illustrate that point sometimes"
"<at>_mellyfresh All you have to do is go to StephenA.com. It's right there on the website,...next to a picture of Prof. Gates."
"<at>MissChantelle Thank ya, Ms. Chantelle. Appreciate the love. Always :)"
"<at>DCCocktailsExam Sometimes I wonder about that myself, Dear!"
"<at>LTPyatt this would be true"

"<at>jwade318...deeper than himself and recognize the rest of us aren't friends with President Obama and OPRAH, and to act accordingly. That's.."
"<at>jwade318 ...not what happened. He didn't do that. People think I'm against Gates because I point that out. They're wrong. I pointed it out"
"<at>jwade318...because I don't want the next brother thinking he can act that way and the end result will be the same, because it won't."
"<at>jwade318 There are ways to deal with things, especially if you're someone of Gates' stature. I don't believe he dealt with it the right way"
"<at>jwade318 Perhaps Gates did do things the right way for HIMSELF. But for the young black minds out there he's influenced, I don't think so."
"<at>Livingfora2 Please! Evidently, you don't know me at all. I'm always speaking out on issues that effect our society, especially black folks."
"<at>Redhookz That's a great idea. I'll remember that :)"
"<at>nsisr What are you talking about, sir?"
"<at>Ahav05 In a heartbeat. But only if I were allowed to do other things when I'm not working for them. That's the whole pt of leaving ESPN."

"<at>_MiikeEyRoXx27_ Not exactly, sir! I wrote that he should retire because he was having mild strokes and I was afraid he was going to die.."
"<at>_MiikeEyRoXx27_ ...on the sideline. He was like a father to me. I loved him dearly. Told him what I was going to write and he approved it."
"<at>_MiikeEyRoXx27_ I played for the man. Would not have made it to this point w/o him. But I knew what was happening. He didn't agree, but..."
"<at>_MiikeEyRoXx27_ ...but supported my right, as an aspiring Journalist, to do it and stood by me. That's the truth. No one ever asked, though"
"<at>OBCOMM321 Stay tuned, bro! A lots happening. And anything is possible :)"
"<at>Joshqpublic That's because I'm usually not talking to you, Josh. I'm usually answering a direct question from someone else. Just like now."
"<at>The_Young_Princ Yes Sir! Had a little time, so that's what I've been doing. About to get off, though. Take care."
"<at>StarChyld2525 I intend to. It just won't be on ESPN, that's all."
"<at>_MiikeEyRoXx27_ Good! Then you understand exactly where I'm coming from. Please tell Clarence Jr. and the rest of the family I send my love"

"<at>Robert_Connor Appreciate the offer from Rev. Jackson, but I wouldn't go :-)"

"<at>NubianSage Amen!"
"<at>Tsurod I'd certainly describe it in a way far different than what McNabb's father used. This is serious."

"<at>SwamiG8R I absolutely love it when fools literally try to question my oratorical skills. Keep trying, Bro! Knock yourself out."

"<at>Charliezegers Wasn't me, bro! I wanted to keep my show. They asked me to give it up to focus more on TV. I'd be back at 1050 in a heartbeat"
"Looks like DATELINE pushed back the Steve McNair/athletes and woman story. Sorry peeps"
"<at>pwrvoices4kids Yes Sir! I apologize. I only went by what the folks at Dateline told me. Again, my apologies. Maybe they'll air it next week"
"<at>Spikeaji So what. Regardless of what Glenn Beck says, he's no dummy. Nor does he represent EVERYTHING Fox feels. Opposing views are good."

"<at>mj3williams Man, these folks told me they've had some service difficulty. I actually recorded a Podcast that couldn't play. I'm on it."
"<at>thesportskennel I taped it already. More than a week ago. They're the ones who told me it was coming on last night. Maybe Friday or next wk"
"<at>MikeFrancesaNY Thanks my man. Appreciate the love."
"<at>Tanespasev Not true at all. I have no problem with Vick serving jailtime. But he served it. Enough's enough. Leave the man alone, already."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Thanks for listening, Bro! Did ya like'em???"

"<at>SportsVentz Doubt that'll happen this season. TNT likes C-Webb. Plus, I think Barkley and myself together would be too much for networks :)"

"<at>Mark_Bradley I'd put them back in the Eastern Conference Finals. They should lose to Boston then, though."

"<at>IThinkImaGenius Maybe you're right. But I'm not giving up. I believe I have 20 more years in this business."
"<at>BxSwagBoy Late night or Daytime?"
"<at>Kylewiggins No dawg! You're that proud brother. Don't call yourself that."
"<at>Marty2634 The best time you could have as a Journalist. Right up until the moment you're worried about league officials talking to ur boss"

"<at>Dmeat24 I can live with that."
"<at>Bootdagawt Why not. Whatever channel, I'm going to be ME. I'll tone down the volume, but a network won't change my belief system."
"<at>marshallgraves So would I."
"<at>Werunallstar Depends on who it's for, what exactly I'll be asked to do and how much I'll be paid."
"<at>Marty2634 Nope! I wanted to be a criminal lawyer"
"<at>Shariten That's one of my worse secrets: I've watched General Hospital for 30 years now. Never - ever - miss it. Even the cast was shocked."
"<at>Bootdagawt The key is always to be yourself. I call things like I see it. Just because I'm black doesn't mean I always agree with Obama."
"<at>Bootdagawt But that doesn't mean that if I did agree with him, I'd hesitate to say so just because I was working at FoxNews."
"<at>Bootdagawt FoxNews, CNN or MSNBC. They're all great in their own ways. If I'm lucky/fortunate enough to end up w/ 1 of them, I'll be me."

"<at>Tagirl27 Shhhhhh! Stay tuned, sweety. I have plans :)"
"<at>Marty2634 No! My ESPN days are over. They're choice; not mine. Love appearing on any show that gives you time to talk. One of my dreams:..."
"<at>Marty2634 I'd love to be a guest for an hour on Larry King Live. I'd love for him to ask me about Sports, Politics and the Black Community."
"<at>Bootdagawt Let me make you a promise right here and now: NOTHING ABOUT ME WILL EVER BE FIXED. I will always be me; will always be real."
"<at>the_Real_MikeL Ha Ha!!! How 'bout those Yankees. Yeah! Yeah! yeah!"
"<at>Shairten I'd go back on in a heartbeat. I'd do it for FREE, too. But I want to be a criminal...in a scene with Sonny and Jason :)"

"HAAA!
About to be on MSNBC at 4 pm local, then CNN Headline News at 5 AND 6 pm local (EST). Talking Rick Pitino and his sex scandal"
"Been on CNN Headline News since 5 pm. Still here now. Just finished speaking on Pitino's comments. About to come back on now!!!"
"<at>PaulBFree Thanks, Paul. Much appreciated. Always trying to bring a fresh perspective."
"<at>alexsc21 Wrong, Alex! He brought that up to point out how Louisville was there for HIM. I initially was skeptical about that myself."
"<at>Deionescobar Keep plugging along. Know what you have to offer whoever you're talking to and make those points to a potential employer."
"<at>Alexsc21 Racism isn't dead, bro! But that doesn't mean you should waste your energy thinking about something you can't control."
"<at>MikeFrancesaNY If I thought this were really Mike Francesa, I'd take that offer in a heartbeat to guest host. But I know better :)"
"<at>Sportsbabe001 Feel whatever you want. I respectively disagree. I did NOT defend Pitino. I simply stated: He's denied the rape and abortion"
"<at>Sportsbabe001 charge. Outside of that, what goes on with his life is his business. We don't know if he was miserable at home or not. We..."
"<at>Sportsbabe001 ..need to mind our business. Especially since all the man has to do is win a few basketball games before he's given a pass..."
"<at>Sportsbabe001..a pass, anyway. Let's stop the nonsense. We've got bigger things to worry about than what's going on in someone's bedroom."
"<at>tgeer15 Yes sir! May 1st."
"<at>1aceofspades Thanks, Bro. I try as often as I can."
"<at>Donniehoward2 Thank you, sir! I feel the same, exact, way."

"<at>JSKCKNIT Yeah! Didn't know. What happened after I left?"
"<at>Soulsurvivor82 I'm use to it by now. Quite Honestly, no one wants to touch on how many unhappy men are out here. Seriously!"
"<at>krisadamslcpd Always"

"<at>Dru_U Thank You!"
"<at>K_Fresh1517 He'll be just fine. Nothing another Final Four appearance won't fix."

"<at>Davebeard Works for me"
"My goal would be to have as many followers as Kim Kardashian someday. But I'm a smart man. I look nothing like her, so that isn't possible"
"<at>Purplediva13 It was good. At least that's what people tell me."
"<at>itwit4food Wouldn't bother me to meet any of them."
"<at>blin210 You will. That's certainly my intention."
"<at>Deionescobar Thanks, my man. Much appreciated."
"<at>Iamillmatic I doubt it, but they'll be better. However, they're not going but so far until Greg Oden shows up and justifies himself"
"<at>cscoordinator Nah! They'll win about the same amount this season as last."
"<at>AngelJulian Thanks Angel. Much appreciated. I'll do what I can."
"<at>jasonmorgannews The answer would be YES! If he were healthy. But he isn't, and the Celts have Rasheed. So the answer is No."
"<at>KennyHamilton Haaaaaaaaaa"
"<at>James_frinzi Thanks James. Appreciate ya."
"<at>its_manila Haaaaa. This is true."
"<at>FARRAH1228 Thank ya, Farrah. Loving the compliments on this issue. FROM THE LADIES. NOT THE GENTLEMEN."

Thanks for the kind words."
"<at>supapimp Amen to that :)"
"<at>Marty2634 The Orlando Magic will be in the picture, but I don't think Vince will take them any further. He could've been Kobe if hungry."
"BTW....I love Pres. Obama, but I swear I'm sick and damn tired of these town halls and press conferences. Campaign time is over. Get it done"
"<at>Coleman1333 That's assuming that's the truth. Fact is, these folks have legitimate concerns. Our deficit + the Obama's spending = no relief"
"<at>Mikeslim I totally agree. If I don't have one tomorrow, fire me :) But if I do, band together and get me a bunch of followers. Then..."
"<at>Mikeslim ...I'll do one every day :)"
"<at>Shambi8 Yes Maam! I just don't trust any politician when they don't get out of campaign mode. I feel hoodwinked when they do that."
"<at>NickRinaldi True that! So that means I need to build more followers :)"
"<at>Donpaciani Wasn't good or thorough enough. That's why there's so much debate."
"Donte Stallworth has been suspended for the season. For the record, I support Roger Goodell's decision on this matter. Stallworth deserved.."
"...to be suspended for the entire season w/o pay. I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt anyone but he did KILL a man -- and spent just 24 days..."
"....In jail."
"Bottom line: Not being paid for the entire season is much better than significant jail time. He got off easy. Period"
"<at>USER_ALLSTAR I wouldn't go that far. Stallworth didn't mean to kill the man. I'm just saying a year-long suspension is an appropriate price"
"<at>champlife Vick's actions were intentional, ya'll. Let's not confuse the two. Don't use Vick to justify wanting harsher penalty/Stallworth"
"<at>GJackson1o23 That's a good point, G."
"<at>BFaust32 Has nothing to do with him being a troublemaker. He was drinking and driving. A man was killed as a result. Period. Get over it."
"<at>Keithswilliams I'm saying the NFL has its conduct policy. So whenever the law seems to give someone a pass for an obviously egregious act.."
"<at>Keithswilliams ..I have no problem with the league stepping in to say you've damaged our image with your actions, and we can't condone this"
"<at>Keithswilliams My argument for Vick differs, somewhat, because the man served hard time. While we can argue that Vick's 18 months in prison"
"<at>Keithswilliams ...is severe enough, NO ONE WITH SENSE can dispute that Stallworth spending 24 days in jail is a just penalty for his crime."
"<at>Keithswilliams..So if he has to spend a year away from the game with no pay, I believe that's justify. BTW...expect a Podcast on this"
"<at>Keithswilliams ...within the next couple of hours."
"<at>K_Marcel Evidently they can. They just did it."
"<at>MyNYSports There's one poignant point a lot of folks are missing: With all the warnings, there is NO DAMN EXCUSE to DUI. NO DAMN EXCUSE."
"One last thing on Goodell: He couldn't do a damn thing if the Players Union collectively bargained him having limited power. Remember that."

"<at>the_real_ebbert I'd rather be an idiot than a heartless bastard. Know this: On my worse day, I never wish for anyone to be unemployed."
"<at>ike7478 Who said anything about Pitino being a class act? All I'm saying is that so long as the man didn't break any laws, his business..."

"D-Wade wanted O.J. Mayo, feeling star-potential was written all over that kid. I, myself, felt Beasley was the man, but had SERIOUS ???...."
"...about Beasley being in SOUTH BEACH. I keep telling everyone: S.Beach is an ADDICTION. Everyone can't handle it. Especially grown kids."
"On a Political note: I think it's absolutely DISGRACEFUL that th Obama Administration is allowing CIA interrogation techniques to be..."

"...make sure it doesn't happen from this day forward. Our country was under attack. Desperate times call for desperate measures. To even..."
"...entertain this is ridiculous. Almost as ridiculous as it is to tell the world the U.S. DOES NOT TORTURE! You don't want to torture? Fine."
"Any reasonable human being should not have a problem with that position. But why advertise it to the world?  Why can't we just shut up and.."
"...do it. To me, that's the equivalent of telling a robber you've caught in your home: ""Don't worry! Even though I've got this guy I won't.."
"...shoot you! It makes no sense, whatsoever. Intimidation, many times, is the greatest deterrent. Oh well, I've said my peace. For now!"
"<at>ZerlinaM Come on Zerlina. YOu're trying to tell me you really think Holder is acting independently? The same guy who begged for Marc Rich.."
"<at>ZerlinaM ...to be pardoned after evading more than $48 million in taxes and charged w/ 51 counts of tax fraud. It's Political, sweety."
"<at>ZerlinaM If yo think Holder is operating independently of the Obama Administration, I've got some swamp land to sell you. Right here in NJ"

"<at>Jeffreyjwhite Come on, Jeffrey. He's the President. When are we going to stop putting things on other people. The buck stops with him."
"<at>Filmoredollar Agreed! But I still don't believe he could've pulled off Universal Healthcare. If so, he would've done it a long time ago."
"<at>Fleetwood78 No advice will help Roy Williams. He's got to ball. Period. They let go of T.O. Now he's got to pick up the slack OR STEP OFF."

"<at>Bootdagawt Bro! I'm gonna say this one more time: I'm an independent. Conservative some ways; liberal in others. Partisan ways are NOT me."
"<at>Bootdagawt It's Fox News, MSNBC, CNN. Makes no difference to me. I go by what's right, not what favors one side or the other. That has..."
"<at>Bootdagawt ...ALWAYS been me. It always will be me. It's what's Right and it's what's real. So don't ever -- ever -- expect me to change."
"<at>Bootdagawt If I have a problem with Obama, I'm going to say it. Just the  same as I would call out Nancy Pelosi, John McCain or anyone else"
"<at>Bootdagawt I don't owe Obama a thing. I VOTED FOR THE MAN. Gave him the max donation of $2,300. Got some Republicans I know to vote for him"
"<at>Bootdagawt My job is done. Now it's time for him to do his, which means fixing this economy and staying the hell off the T.V. Campaign is.."
"<at>Bootdagawt ...is over. Enough already. And there isn't a black person alive who should want me to be otherwise. Fair is Fair."
"<at>ZerlinaM Thank you, Sweetheart!"
"<at>rsoussi Could be. Anything's possible."
"<at>fleetwood78 Yep! Gotta admit, though. I like his show :-)"
"<at>Rafael-Borras Doubt it. Think Riles is worried about A.I. In South Beach. Would love to see him there, though. Iverson is getting screwed."
"<at>rafael-borras I know A.I. Has somewhat of a checkered past, but he deserves better. He is NOT washed up. He's still good for 20 ppg"
"<at>Vcaines Hey! I'm not saying I WANT someone to be tortured, although desperate times call for desperate measures. But...the one thing I do.."
"<at>Vcaines ...know is you don't need to ADVERTISE that you won't torture. The element of intimidation could be a great deterrent."
"<at>luayrahil Absolutely! Could not have said it better myself"
"<at>lefwingop503 Actually, it doesn't mean all that much to me when it comes to the issue of our National Security"
"<at>PoliticistaTika Excuse me, Dear! We happen to agree. Others tried to say Holder was operating independent of the admin. I disagreed, like u"
"<at>Urban_Politico I don't believe Holder passes gas w/o Obama's permission."
"<at>TheRealSlamMan No doubt! Thank ya."
"<at>Certndeath haaaaaaa"
"<at>brianflowaz thank ya"
"<at>Fleetwood78 I could give less than a Frog's fat backside how many haters I have. So long as I'm speaking the truth as I see it, who cares!"
"<at>Fleetwood78 Thanks for the kind words on the Podcast, Btw..."
"<at>ZerlinaM In case you haven't figured it out, Zerlina, I don't give a damn what an Ex-CIA official has to say. This stuff shouldn't be....."
"<at>ZerlinaM publicized. There's no upside to this for America as it concerns Nat'l Security. Now the FBI is in charge. Girl, Please!"
"<at>ChiBangin He's a Bad Boy. He'll be fine"
"<at>CP3Fan Who isn't a fan of Chris Paul? He's the best PG in the game. I'm tryin to make time for his Golf Torunament in Sept. He invited me."

"<at>Timiznice Hey! The point of twitter on my OWN PERSONAL ACCOUNT is for it to be whatever I want it to be. Sometimes I'm brief; other times.."
"<at>Timiznice I'm not going to be. If that's too much, go to another account. All it takes is the touch of a button. Shouldn't be that hard"
"<at>CavsAndy96 Cool. Bye Bye! Although I have no idea what you're talking about in regards to breaking the law. I certainly don't condone that"
"<at>ZerlinaM Yes Maam! I'm aware that you think I'm wrong. Understood."
"<at>tmobile67 Plaxico never turned down a 3-month deal. Never happened."
"<at>Alexsc21 Thanks for the compliment. I think :)"
"<at>SamSeder What I said about torture was....if you're not going to do it...Fine! But why do you have the ADVERTISE it? Just don't do it."

"<at>NCHOUND79 Not anytime soon. But who knows."
"<at>Dlkall01 Shaq is my mind, but he doesn't want any of this :-)"
"<at>ZerlinaM Not condoning torture, Zerlina. Just saying desperate times pave the way for desperate things. U don't move past by harking on it."
"<at>SamSeder Sir, I'm just being real. If I have a terrorist in my grasp who's threaten to kill my family..and has a family member, there's no"
"<at>SamSeder...limit to what I may do to save a family member. That's the context in which I'm addressing the issue of torture."
"<at>ZerlinaM Well, I haven't read Jane Mayer's book yet. Perhaps I will then get back to you. Just don't bring up what's legal and what isn't."
"<at>ZerlinaM These folks on the Hill do what they want, how they want, when they want. Especially when one party is trying to stain the other."
"<at>ZerlinaM I'm not interested in hearing about what's legal, what's right or wrong, because all of these folks have chosen to employ those..."
"<at>ZerlinaM ..beliefs arbitrarily. None of them are to be trusted, which is why I'm an Independent."
"<at>SamSeder Absolutely  not, for the most part. But I'd like some wiggle room as it pertains to our National Security."
"<at>ZerlinaM We'll agree to disagree. What perturbs me is that people assume I don't know the facts b/c my POV is different. I just don't feel"
"<at>ZerlinaM ...the way you and others feel. Period. I'm telling you what I believe it. I don't need a playbook of rules to guage what I feel."
"<at>ZerlinaM I know the DOJ is independent, but I don't believe Holder operates independent of Obama all the time. Period. If someone were to.."
"<at>ZerlinaM ..to threaten to harm my family and I had a chance to take them out...it's done. PERIOD! If I were faced with an extreme scenario"
"<at>ZerlinaM ...of someone kidnapping my loved one and I may have to squeeze it out of them, by any means necessary, I'm doing it. Period."
"<at>ZerlinaM That doesn't make me ill-informed. It just means I feel differently than you. You have your limits; I have mine. That's that."
"<at>ZerlinaM And my opinion is what it is after I've looked at all the issues. Hell with it. I'm a bad guy. I'd torture a bastard who tried to"
"<at>ZerlinaM ...harm my loved ones. This conversation has gone on for too long. Neither of us are about to change the other's mind."
"<at>ColinScanlon Thanks, my man."
"<at>christine1doll Stay tuned! I've got a couple of things coming down the pike. I'll let everyone know when it's time. Thanks for the concern"
"<at>theverdict I don't think so, barring a LeBron explosion. To me, Boston is better."
"<at>iivoreee You may be right about my logic, but i'm just being honest about how I feel, my man."
"<at>Sluggahjells My man, no one is debating right or wrong pertaining to the law. What I was saying is what I'd do if faced w/ that situation."

"<at>Sesan72 ...in a free-market society and limited Gov't. To me, the Gov't should ensure fairness and an equal playing field. That's all."

"<at>Mrs406 U don't know. What do you mean."
"<at>ReggieReg_24 I'm disappointed in you, Reg. To Hell with the next 15 years. I'm expected -- and hoping for that -- from you a lot sooner."

"<at>Sillyman1001 expressing themselves and look where you go. You should be ashamed of yourself."

"Btw....in case anyone didn't hear my prediction earlier in the week: Mayweather will win tonight. KO in round 9. Love Marquez, though."
"Just finished watching the Mayweather fight, then the post-fight interview. Sugar Shane Mosley was CLASSLESS to interrupt him the way he did"
"Mayweather was TOTALLY in the right to ask ""Respect me as a man."" And Max Kellerman -- a colleague I respect -- was wrong to say Mayweather"
"Gets in his own way and has a chip on his shoulder. Kellerman should've insisted Sugar Shane step off. He won. He was entitled to an...."
"Uninterrupted interview. Period."
"<at>jkracin731 If I were Mayweather, I wouldn't grant Sugar Shane a fight just b/c of that nonsense. Fight Pacquaio and call it a wrap."
"<at>THErandman You shouldn't give Shane props. I know he's down to earth. A real good guy, actually. But he was wrong on this way."
"<at>JamesJ1963 Thanks James. Deeply appreciate the kind words."
"<at>fleetwood78 It's coming my man. Patience. When I'm back, everyone will know. Trust me."
"<at>cjeffduncan Appreciate the respect, but it isn't necessary. I don't expect half the folks to agree with me most times. That's how we learn."
"<at>SportsAddicted Absolutely. He doesn't need Sugar Shane. Before he beat Margarito, no one was thinking of Shane. Look what Cotto did to him."
"<at>ghettouprising I'm not going to go that far because I know and like Kellerman. I just think he was wrong to allow Sugar Shane to butt in."
"I'm sitting here listening to Rush Limbaugh's show and he has some dude imitating Black Folks talking, spewing slang, etc, while talking...."

"<at>RobbieMcGowan I do support Obama. Will always have love for my brother. But what brother doesn't get in another %$*& when they're messin up"
"<at>KeithWilliams Think what you want, Keith. You're entitled. All I have is 16 years of saying exactly what I believe/feel. That won't change."
"<at>Driquo Yes! I do want Obama to succeed. So thank you for recognizing that. I don't trust Pelosi, Frank, Reid and the others, though."
"<at>Gean37 It's coming, Boss! Stay tuned."
"<at>iAMhawk2 I absolutely believe a majority of Plaxico's sentence should be Community Service. But what can you do, ya know!"

"OMG....I'm about to have a Heart Attack. Brett Favre finally said something I agree. That Adrian Peterson may be the best RB he's ever seen."
"<at>psu_pride I've got no problem with that at all. So long as people don't let their biases ignore the facts before them."
"<at>Tyran1125 Good damn point. Barry Sanders was a bad man. But he didn't have A.P.'s breakaway speed."

"<at>LBelton I know this. And like I said: I support Obama from the standpoint of wishing me well. But I don't agree with what I've seen so far."
"<at>CashAlbright Not as troubling as it is for me. I love the brother, but I'm not feeling what he's doing. And like I've said: I trust NO Pol."

"<at>beasley1110 But Ofcourse! I never miss General Hospital. I TIVO every episode :)"
"<at>Momofeak Like I said, I criticize Obama when I think he deserves it. And I'll praise him the same. I happen to agree with Obama's tactics.."
"<at>Momofeak ...on Iran. Building a Nat'l Coalition is the way to go, considering our Military already has enough on its hands. Smart decision."
"<at>Z0HAIB I personally believe he's only doing it to promote his clothing line. Red Carpet treatment, etc. Both of them benefit. Hollywood :)"
"<at>AndrewBoutros Yes, I do believe Kobe is still the best in the world. LeBron still has a few things to prove. But watch out for D-Wade."
"Btw...My website is back up and running everybody. Feel free to go to it. I'll have a Podcast in the next day or so. For now..."
"I'm heading to D.C. for the Congressional Black Caucus. They're having a Black-Tie Dinner and, ofcourse, Obama is scheduled to speak."
"<at>nickarapoglou Say what you want about me, Bro! But I sincerely hope your kid brother is not a ""KID."" I never -- ever -- turn down kids."
"<at>Nickarapoglou It's a flat-out lie for you to say that and I don't appreciate it."
"<at>Filmoredollar Hey, the man turned my Momma against me. I'll give him a chance but he is not in my good graces right now :)"
"<at>Sesan72 Can't stand Big Government. But I'll be happy if Pelosi is gone, and the Republicans take over the house. Then, Obama wins in 2012"
"<at>epheezy I believe Obama is doing too much. Take care of the economy first and put money back in folks pocket, then come with Healthcare."
"<at>Epheezy But when folks are struggling to pay their bills, then you push for a healthcare bill everyone's convinced will cost, that provides"
"<at>Epheezy a dis-incentive for folks to hire or the keep the folks they have. Unemployment continues to escalate and we're all more dependent"
"<at>Epheezy on big government. I don't approve or agree with that. I believe Obama's heart is in the right place, but he's capitulating."
"Had a beautiful time at the Congressional Black Caucus last night. Met up with a whole bunch of folks. CongressWoman Maxine Waters was one.m"
"House Majority Whip, James Clyburn was another. My man, Dr. Mchael Eric Dyson, and ofcourse Attorney General Eric Holder. Pres. Obama gave.."
"A wonderful speech, as usual. Our First Lady continues to prove she's brought SEXYNESS to the W.H. But I also met up with Charlotte Bobcats'"
"Owner, Bob Johnson. He had a really nice party at his nightclub, POSH, last night, using it as a charity event to benefit the underprivilege"
"Saw future NFL Hall of Famer, Emmitt Smith and his lovely wife there, too, getting loose on the dance floor. Forgot he'd won Dancing W/stars"
"Overall, really nice and productive evening. Weird having a bunch of folks approaching me to talk Politics, though. Didn't know I was being"
"Seen/noticed by so many people. One guy from the W.H. Approached me and said..""Oh! We're watching. We see you."" Oh Well, time to bring my..."

"Haaaaaaa!!!! Just met the great Danny Glover. I've always loved this man. He's always looking out for US. It was an honor to meet him."
"<at>Sesan72 Obama's only chance at re-election is if Pelosi is gone. I guarantee you the Democrats will lose in 2010 OR 2012. Pick one!"
"<at>WiIlBenRoberts Black folks. Danny Glover is always looking out for US. Is that a problem?"
"<at>DJGrandman Probably! Simply because he wants out and the Knicks want him gone. He needs to go, though. Whatever way it happens, so be it."
"<at>pdubb48 I believe I do."
"<at>wobblebody Let'em come. I'll be more ready than ever. I'm rested and HIGHLY motivated. A lot has happened to me. I've got a lot to prove."

"<at>Princecharle It's an absolute disgrace. And it's exactly why I don't care to hear a single damn thing about Racism. What possible excuse"
"<at>Princecharle can anyone come up with to justify this kid -- and honor roll student -- being murdered. It's sickening. And I'll tell you...."
"<at>Princecharle something else, too. This is one of the reasons why I believe in the DEATH PENALTY. Certain people just need to go. They need"
"<at>Princecharle to be sent someplace for God to deal with them -- or the Devil. They just need to be separated from the human race. Their soul"
"<at>Princecharle is gone. Screw all the rehabilitation crap. Why should anyone who'd do something like that be re-habbed. I'm sorry, but that's"
"<at>Princecharle how I feel. I'm getting off-line now. I was fine until broaching this subject. Now I'm totally pissed."

"<at>fleetwood78 No way in hell. Don't believe it. They're not good enough. A.I. will help anybody. But he should've been in NY or Charlotte."
"<at>Robyensz Call ESPN. Fox. MSNBC. FoxNews or CNN. I have no control over this stuff. But the next time I get my own show, it'll be right."
"<at>BGeniusSports I'll tell you this damn much: I'm going to stop talking to people who lie on me. I compared Ellis to MJ? F-ing RIDICUOUS"

"<at>btpayne all I'm concerned with is doing the best I can do and focusing on being much more appreciative of the support I receive. That's it."
"<at>btpayne However...I'd really appreciate it if folks got their #s accurate. I had a very successful show on 1050 ESPN Radio. I was asked to"

"<at>amichellemack I will, my dear. Have no plans of slowing down."
"<at>CBIWNL Told you I wouldn't let you down, bro!"
"<at>chontezm Moves for Ben Gordon and Charlie V were good, but they still need a star in the post and they don't have it. They're average."
"<at>seank7575 I think they're better because they're tougher defensively. But that still doesn't make them better than Boston."
"<at>Chrisin206 Don't ever -- EVER -- let politicians/politics steal your job. Keep watching the greatest game in the world."
"<at>Marty2634 The Magic's chances are very good. But I don't think VC in place of Turkoglu is an upgrade. I like Bass alongside Howard, though."
"<at>Chrisin206 Portland's a good team to root for. They'll be much better with Andre Miller at PG. If Oden stays healthy, look out."
"<at>LuayRahil I will, Bro! Thanks a bunch."
"On a very sad note, I don't know how many of you know Garrard McClendon, a young black man who hosts his own show on CLTV in CHICAGO. I just"

"They were murdered. Both shot to death. I just wanted to take a moment to extend my deepest sympathy to Garrard and his family. I don't know"
"the brother. But not only does he seem like a great guy, no one deserves what he's going through right now. This DAMN VIOLENCE has got to"
"stop. It's bad enough we're killing one another in the black community. But it's regressed to another level when we're killing our mothers"
"and fathers. Something has got to be done about this. My prayers are with Garrard and his family. I know I'm not alone in saying this."
"<at>Kaidupe Actually, it wasn't that great. I gave the impression that Crystal Meth was a performance enhancer and that's not what I was trying"
"<at>Kaidupe to say. I was trying to say that if Agassi was using that, what else was he using en route to going from No. 141 to No. 1 in 2 yrs?"
"<at>gcarolthomas Thank you, Madam!"

"<at>Joshtruelove Who in the Hell said anything about RACE? I said the brother's PARENTS WERE MURDERED. I'm talking crime in our community."
"<at>Joshtruelove Josh, I am a BLACK MAN. I see US killing one another more than I hear about it in any other community. If you can't understand"
"<at>Joshtruelove that my sensitivity to my community doesn't mean I wish any harm or am insensitivity to any other community, I can't help you."
"<at>jamsolo904 Not necessarily. I'll still be doing sports. I just didn't want to be limited to it, that's all."
"<at>bobcarroll24 Thanks, Bob. Much appreciated."
"<at>fleetwood78 Yeah! I should've been better prepared, though. I wanted to make the point that that probably wasn't ALL Agassi was doing."
"<at>Gruposlogan120 No! I love Jameer Nelson. But they were better off with Turkoglu's outside game. Not VC. Love Bass with Howard, though."
"<at>CBIWNL No problem, Bro! Looking forward to it."
"<at>bzahar35 Could've been better. Wasn't my best. But I'll recover."
"<at>blele15 No problem! I'll announce where I'll be in a few days. Just working things out contractually. Appreciate the kind words."
"<at>ussportspages Yeah! Dan's a really nice guy. He's got a bright future ahead of him. I like the guy, and enjoyed working with them a lot."
"<at>Joshtruelove I can appreciate your pt, Josh. But you're just going to have to get over it. It's obvious that murder of any kind is terrible"
"<at>Joshtruelove But I'm not about to back up AT ALL from highlighting the plight of black-on-black crime. It's devastated my community. It's"

"Sorry I've been out the loop, folks. Been busy trying to finalize things. Today, I interviewed 50 Cent for BET's Upcoming Special: Food..."

"Hope everyone enjoyed their weekend. Fyi....I'll be on CNN tonight at 10 pm with Anderson Cooper. Topic: NJ Gubernatorial Race. See ya!!!"
"Fyi.....my segment on CNN with Anderson Cooper for tonight at 10 has been cancelled. I'm told James Carville couldn't make it. Another time!"
"Fyi......FoxNews has asked me to do a 1-on-1 today inside the STRATEGY ROOM today in the 1 o'clock hour. It airs on FoxNews.Com"
"Hey, I'm here chillin at the Knicks/Cavs game tonight at the Garden. I predicted before the game LeBron might drop 50 tonight and I'm right"
"On target. He's hitting jumpers from everywhere. The Knicks can't stop him at all, and he's busy laughing and looking over at Jay-Z and AROD"
"After every shot....smiling like it's nobody's business."
"He's already got 14 points with 1:37 left in the 1st QT. Looks like trouble. If the Knicks' continue to look this bad, he'll never come"
"LeBron just hit a 3-pt to end the QT. Cavs are up 40-21. Nat'l TV. This is not looking good."
"Just arrived back from Atlanta, hanging with Steve Harvey. His morning show is doing wonderful things. One of them is partnering with Disney"

"<at>djmrking Excuse me?"
"<at>Pantherzfan4lif Good afternoon."
"<at>TonyMoustakelis Honestly? Not a damn thing. MJ has six rings. He NEVER lost in the NBA Finals. He was MVP every time. Kobe lost twice."
"<at>TZEIGLER24 My heart goes out to A.I. He's not perfect but he doesn't deserve what's happening to him. It's like folks are lined up vs. him."
"<at>NoYork That's LeBron. Very smart, I might add."
"<at>Iamlevell_LTL I agree. A.I. should've always been in New York or Charlotte with Larry Brown. He should've never sniffed at Memphis."
"<at>thunderstrike11 Yes! It was the Dr. Dre from Yo MTV Raps. He pairs with Chuck D on Air America every Sunday night from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m."
"<at>insidepitch1909 Wasn't pitching a thing. Grew up listening to Dr. Dre and Chuck D. They asked me to come on, so I came on. Simple."
"<at>mttymcg I'd love it. Somehow, I doubt CNN would take that chance on me, though. But I'd love that challenge. Just let me put that out there"
"New radio interviews are posted on the Media page of www.StephenA.com"
"<at>pariah79 It's pretty hard for the brother to hear folks saying he's lost it, then ride the bench. He's got a lot of pride. That simple."
"<at>thefinalwordjj Always appreciate the love. Especially from my homies."
"<at>tjwacker Didn't see it. Was traveling back from the Atlanta. But I know the kid is nice. Another mistake the Knicks made on draft night."
"<at>HecklingSociety I don't respond to ya'll much. Don't have time for the nonsense. But don't think I DON'T like ya'll. I appreciate the love."
"<at>Alpratt Style or no style, I know I'd get the job done. all I need are the topics and the freedom to do what I do. I'm that confident."

"<at>jmo310 That's not my only new gig. Another one's coming. Still can't announce it, though. Contract stuff :)"
"<at>KwameNixon Always tried to hold onto my roots, Kwame. Never should've been gone in the first damn place, honestly."
"<at>babydoll1162515 I LOOVVVEEE THE ATL. That's why I'm glad I'm not there. Sodom and Gomorrah. I'm honest. Can't take it. Just can't."
"<at>LaVern25 Hopefully, better times are ahead once I get back."
"<at>JWill1523 I absolutely agree with that assessment."
"<at>Steelymcbeam Easiest request in the world. I LOVE Mike Tomlin. I'm a diehard Steelers' fan. Been that way since I was five years old."
"<at>seank7575 appreciate the love, boss. But the Eagles are not Super Bowl contenders. Not when they lose at home to the Cowboys. Not yet."
"<at>SwinCash Yes Dear! That's part of the plan. Miss ya much. Hope you're well. Still watching. Still proud of ya."
"<at>mhgatti Thanks, my man. Appreciate that love. Keep it coming and spread the word."

"<at>momofeak Thank. Appreciate the love. I'll keep it coming."
"Hey ya'll. I'm in damn Milwaukee, Wisconsin for the weekend. But it's for a good cause. My man, Garry D. Howard is celebrating his 50th BDAY"
"LeBron James wants to initiate a league-wide petition that essentially calls for Michael Jordan's No.23 to be retired. I totally agree."
"King James says he's willing to change his jersey from No.23 to No.6 after this season, especially since the NBA logo belongs to Jerry West."
"Personally, I'd prefer the league logo changed from a silhouette of West to MJ -- who's simply just more deserving. But a retired # will do."
"<at>Selmasdad Absolutely. I love Pacquaio, but I'd pick Floyd to beat him. I don't bet against Mayweather. Period."
"<at>TheBigA47 Thanks. Much appreciated."
"<at>FAMUAce No disrespect to Russell either, but NO ONE TRUMPS MJ. Russell may have won, but he didn't make the game popular/mainstream."
"<at>projectpat214 Don't know what you're talking about?"
"<at>iamlevell_LTL Brandon Jennings IS a bad, bad boy, though. The kid is nice."
"<at>mihiru Bottom line, the NBA wouldn't be what it is today popularity-wise if it were not for MJ. Not taking away from anyone else, but..."
"<at>anilizerDee I didn't say it WOULD HAPPEN. I said it SHOULD happen."
"<at>Kowboyfan Yes Sir!!!"
"<at>Robbie_MacMac I agree. But it didn't happen. Can't make the news networks hire me, bro."
"<at>akaDaBigG They should. I know that much."
"<at>TonyCornishJr Can't see A.I. returning to Philly, bro. Sorry."
"<at>CBIWNL Sorry, bro. I've got so much stuff going on. It's been crazy. In a few weeks, you'll understand everything I've been going through."
"<at>BlackMediaScoop Thank you much. Appreciate the love."
"<at>BrandonTierney My sentiments, exactly, big boy. The Knicks should bring A.I. to the Garden. Absolutely nothing to lose. Keep it coming."
"<at>MrMarin88 But ofcourse :)"
"<at>Jcwean Haaaaaaaaaa. Hilarious!!! And probably true."
"<at>Freddy_fland Who cares."
"<at>Robbie_MacMac Doubt it. I think Cleveland would be scared to pull that trigger."
"<at>AlexTomter Because?????????"
"<at>RedHookz I definitely did. It's what I was told and I'm still holding out hope. But the Knicks look so awful, it'll turn anyone off now."
"<at>Jon_Locke Thank you, sir. Just love Mark Levin. Don't agree with EVERYTHING he says, but I have profound respect for him. Knows his stuff"
"<at>BDalreadyPT5 Not by a long shot."
"<at>_Mar_co_ Nope. Can't see it."
"<at>/big8beezy I'm not on 1st and 10 anymore because I'm not at ESPN anymore. That ended last May 1st."
"<at>chanceevents 50-50"
"<at>freemaxb1 Thanks a lot, my man. Deeply appreciate the supportive words. Glad I inspire folks. Means a lot to me. I'll try to keep it coming"
"<at>amichellemack PROACTIVE!!!"
"<at>Filmoredollar I'm returning in about 3 weeks, my man. You'll know where soon enough."
"<at>TheAmishShah I hear ya, boss. Appreciate the love very much."
"<at>KillaKage Thanks a lot, my man. Much appreciated."
"<at>asynderman12191 Thanks for noticing, my man. REally appreciated Lil Wayne showing me that kind of love."
"<at>Kowboyfan Nah! Not yet. I've been reinstated, but red tape is delaying everything. Hopefully it'll be resolved real soon."
"<at>IH8cornandcolts Thanks, my man. I'll be back in about 3 weeks. You'll know where soon enough."
"<at>Duker42 Appreciate the love, bro. Really do"
"<at>Scalabrine24 I guess when I get a bit softer and neutral. who knows."
"<at>kenyonnoble Maybe. Maybe not. I may actually agree with half the time."
"Fyi.....now that the Knicks reportedly WON'T sign A.I., he's talking about sitting out the season. I'd like to see him in Cleveland. SOON."
"<at>Redemption_mj Perhaps he wasn't. But he still saw no problem sleeping in the bed with little boys. That's just not good."
"<at>Caliboo818 I agree. But I'd like to see him on a winner. No way in hell he should sit on a bench in MEMPHIS."
"<at>Wannabewriter9 No so fast, sir. He may sit out the season if he doesn't find the right situation. But he'll come back next season."
"<at>Bigdowntown All the answers to that question should be revealed by the end of this week."
"<at>treatsforyou I honestly don't believe the book is closed on him yet. He was hurt last year. healthy and rested, I still think he's lethal."
"<at>anilizerDEE If Delonte West were gone, I really believe A.I. could work in Cleveland. With LeBron, you don't need the quintessential PG."
"<at>mrogi I don't get it with the Palin euphoria. I really don't. But I don't hate on her like Mainstream Media has, either."
"<at>Robinsonreport Nobody more than me, bro. Especially in my case :)"
"CBIWNL My man, I returned Nov. 12. But you may need to read up on what's happening. I'm not allowed to speak on this issue right now."
"<at>BlackMediaScoop Appreciate the love. Thank you so much. But I am fine. Enjoy the Holidays."
"<at>D_Shogun Well, the Dems say they're pushing it through with or without the Republicans. And they have a majority in the house and senate."
"<at>KayeMDMV They're saying the Cavs would need another guard. Can't see it, but anything's possible. A.I. and LeBron have the same agent."
"<at>JHoff89 Sure, no problem. Just let me know when and I'll holla if I'm free. Better time is once Thanksgiving passes, though."
"<at>iamlevell_LTL The Lakers are that good. Especially with Gasol. But my money is still on the Celtics. They're just too experienced to me."
"Breaking News......Breaking News: Allen Iverson's folks just called to inform me Iverson has announced his RETIREMENT. I'll blog later today"
"StephenA.com Exclusive: Allen Iverson's retirement announcement. Check it out."
"<at>Scalabrine24 Thanks, Bro. I appreciate you saying that. But I've got my own show coming very, very soon."
"<at>INEEDASPORTSJOB I'm sorry. Who are you talking about."
"<at>Kingboola Iverson, and others. But I appreciate the thought, boss :)"
"<at>Blackary Nothing at all. I don't believe he's staying retired. But this is how he feels at the moment and I have to respect that."
"<at>Bigvdebo86 There's no question about it. If he got the right call next week, he'd be back next week."
"<at>wetfart5 Nope! Cheesedoodles :)"
"<at>wetfart5 Awwww. Racism on Thanksgiving morning. You should be so proud of yourself :) You're gonna have to come better to bother me, bro :)"
"<at>JohnIsamazing20 Thanks, Bro. It was good to be back on. And I appreciate ESPN for being gracious enough to do it. Lot of class by them."
"<at>HecklingSociety Really! So where's my cheesedoodles :)"
"<at>omezzy227 No, I am NOT back at ESPN. They just had me on because I broke the story. No reunion in the works. But I did enjoy being back."
"Fyi.....I'm about to be on ESPN2 in a few minutes, talking A.I. I'll be on 1st Take. It's a phoner. Sorry! I'm not in studio with Skip :)"
"Check out www.StephenA.com for my column about AI -- ""Answer me this: How bad does Iverson want it? (via FoxSports.com)"""
"<at>MrSimCity Actually, I was just on MSNBC last night on THE ED SHOW talking about the House Minority Speaker's penchant for golf."
"<at>DarrylScott Thanks, bro. Much appreciated."
"<at>TheRealMOA I LOVE Skip Bayless. He says things most other cats are scared to say and he says what he feels. Great friend of mine."
"<at>CBIWNL yeah, it did Bro. I must admit. It made me miss ESPN a lot. But that's how it goes. On to new challenges."
"<at>sportsbabe001 Didn't you read my column or hear me speak. I said I didn't believe him either. But that doesn't change the statement he"
"<at>sportsbabe001 he issued to me. I report what's going on. It's not my problem/issue if he changes his mind. That's for ya'll to deal with."

"<at>chrisnabeta I've been a journalist 16 years bro. Let me make this official: I challenge ANYONE ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH to show me when..."
"<at>Chrisnabeta I've EVER made up a story in my career. IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED. It NEVER WILL HAPPEN. I will put my personal integrity up"
"<at>Chrisnabeta ...and especially my professional integrity up against ANYONE on this planet earth. Years ago. Last year. Last month. Yesterday"
"<at>Chrisnabeta Today. Tomorrow. Next Year. Five years from now. FOREVER! I'm a black man. You don't get ahead at all without integrity. Don't"
"<at>Chrisnabeta ever...ever forget that."
"Um, just to set the record straight for those who think I LIED about Iverson: I do have a statement from him about his retirement."
"If Iverson changes his mind -- which I predict he will -- that's his business. But it doesn't change what I reported. Or that I stand by it."
"<at>Christine1doll Hey Love! Happy Thanksgiving. Hope all is well."
"<at>DRay80 Thanks, Bro. It was nice being back. Very classy on ESPN's part to show me that love. Ofcourse I miss sparring with Skip, too. But.."
"<at>hawksPRman Good to see you too, my man. Always good."
"<at>Mizzzzo Yes Sirrrrrrrrrrrr!!!"
"<at>peterbfletcher So I've heard :)"
"<at>Eaglesfan710 Thank you, sir. Much appreciated."

"<at>peepintommy Yep! Especially when you consider the $$$ involved."

"<at>Rickyromellow We agree on that, bro."
"<at>Robert_Connor Why? We know Tiger is okay and he'll be fine. The only intrigue is whether he cheated on his wife and that's not my business."
"<at>mrogi Spare me. Tiger wouldn't get paid a spec of that if he were not the greatest golfer in the world. He's paid because he's a winner."
"<at>mrogi If Tiger were ranked 100th in the world instead of No. 1, no one would give a damn what's going on with his marriage. Check yourself."

"By now, everyone should know the 76ers officially offered Iverson a 1-year, non-guaranteed deal. It's for approx. $1-mil. Barring any snags,"
"he'll accept the deal on Wednesday. The non-guarantee doesn't matter, because the contract becomes guaranteed the 2nd week in January."
"Bottom line: expect him to show up at the Wachovia Center in a 76ers' uniform next Monday vs. Carmelo and the Nuggets, his old team."

"<at>keithswilliams Trying to make it happen, man. People are going crazy now, listening to me drop some stuff on them."
"<at>zthf20 Please do."
"<at>DarrylScott You're right, bro. But it's really hard when you're in different locations. You'd have to be in a studio to understand."
"<at>kerw00d You're Welcome!!! :)"
"<at>TheAmishShah He's got no business giving that kind of comment. He introduced them. He didn't spread the sheets for them to lay in together."

"<at>hsapley That's total B.S. All i do is give a BLACK PERSPECTIVE. Where are you when I'm calling out black folks? The parts of the problem."
"<at>hsapley SOME white folks never want to hear another perspective. If you don't agree with them completely, you're race-baiter. Grow up!"

"Here at the 76ers/Cavs game. Just don't see how the Sixers can win this. Cavs have too much size. And Elton Brand is not what he use to be."

"<at>PeterJ20 Never. He's too great to surprise me."
"<at>dansballofwax Shouldn't. That's the way it's been for quite a while."

"<at>BaddaDanU I'm not a Conservative, per se. I'm a registered Independent. That means I go on a case-by-case basis. Not ideology."
"<at>secole13 Thank you, my dear."
"<at>roblehrer He's degenerated. I don't believe he's fully recovered from his injuries. What a shame. He looks like a shell of himself."
"<at>Vinnyj78 I think it could work. T-Mac is not a selfish player. He could be Kobe's Pippen. I truly believe this."
"<at>Vinnyj78 R. Allen definitely warrants significant consideration. He's a champion now. He's been one of the best shooters in the NBA for yrs"
"<at>Vinnyj78 Tell us something we don't know."

"<at>NickTheOriginal Anything's possible with Danny Ainge."
"<at>BaddaDanU Forget Obama for a second. Regarding ANY POLITICIAN...what sense does it make to ASSume they're on the up-and-up and can't be ???"
"<at>Vinnyj78 We all feel that way, bro."
"<at>Vinnyj78 He does with Hammonds."
"<at>Bootdagawt Yes, he can be that way. But that's so what. That makes him transparent. Doesn't hurt anyone but himself."
"<at>NickTheOriginal I don't allow my feelings for any individuals perspective to interfere with the information they spew. Right or wrong!"
"<at>_Basiyr_ I have no idea. I'll go to whoever hires me."
"<at>dansballofwax It's possible. All they have to do is start carrying FoxSports Radio in morning drive and they'll have me :)"

"<at>PreciousWilson Thank you, sweety. Much appreciated."

"<at>erickanavathi Impressive. The 76ers have some talent. It's not marquee talent, but it's there."
"<at>DBKamwa I'll be on 3-to-6 a.m. out West, so I suggest you listen to the re-air on Sirius/XM during the day. I'm the East Coast Morning Host"

"tried to make T.O. the scapegoat for all of their troubles. T.O. did not deserve what they did to  him. Their 5-10 record in Decembers was"
"not his fault. But when you're weak, that's what you do: Find someone else to blame but yourself. It's why they're getting beat down tonite"

"<at>Alberto24_7 good looking out, Bro."
"<at>jester8170 90 percent of the time I talk sports. If you're going to let the other 10 percent stop you, so be it. Because all that means is"
"<at>jester8170 that you don't want to hear someone else's perspective. Listening to radio, you're suppose to get the whole person, not just"
"<at>jester8170 the parts you want. That's how you truly know who you're listening too. But good luck in your future endeavors. I hope you find"
"<at>jester8170 what you're looking for. God Bless."
"<at>stayupongame Yeah, you're right. He was really, really depressed last night. Very sad."

"<at>matthewvandyk Who knows, my man. I'll just keep on trying to get better. thanks for listening."
"Just finished doing my segment on HANNITY on FoxNews. I see a lot of folks saw me, so I just wanted to be adamantly clear about my position:"
"Sen. Harry Reid's remarks were insensitive. But everyone's entitled to a mistake. The thing is, when politicians do what they do, which is"
"Say politicize things for their own gain, then the only recourse we have as American citizens is to judge them by the standards THEY SET."
"When Trent Lott spewed his racially insensitive rhetoric about his support for segregationist Strom Thurmond back in 2002, no one wanted to"
"Touch him, including Republicans. They said there was no place for it and Lott should step down. So with that in mind, what's different now?"
"If Lott needed to step down then Reid needs to step down now. Just because the CBC likes his voting record doesn't absolve him. Fair-is-Fair"
"Talking Mark McGwire on my show right now."
"<at>LisaMAC94 keep listening. I'll get to that in a minute. In fact, I'll bring up your name."

"<at>MarieStroughter I like the sound of that.Tell it to them :)"
"<at>mayflowerbvb I totally agree."
"<at>darrelle One has nothing to do with the other. This is based solely on their respective statements and what was done about it. Nothing more"
"<at>SamValley Thank ya."
"<at>pastorrad No I do not. Not at all. But I do believe that since Congressional figures thought Lott should be gone, Reid should get the same."
"<at>bostonrandy Thank God SOMEONE understands the point I was making."
"<at>DeeRamsey We can let partisan politics decide what we should be sensitive too. Politicians have to be held to ONE STANDARD. No waffling."

"<at>Bootdagawt Never once did I say I DID NOT see the difference. What I said was: It doesn't matter when it comes to these politicians. When"
"<at>Bootdagawt they put their foot in their mouths, it's always politicized. If the Dems can do it to the Repubs, why can't it work in reverse?"
"<at>Bootdagawt Fair is Fair. They're ALL OUT FOR THEMSELVES, as far as I'm concerned.  http://myloc.me/2Q7E3"

"<at>Bootdagawt Two black dudes together wouldn't work. Sorry."

"<at>Bootdagawt when they appear on the channel. They allow me to say what I want to say. What they think is of little consequence because I get"

"<at>fleetwood78 That you so much, my man. Means a lot. Remember, it's a morning show. So I've gotta have fun too, which is what I try to do."
"<at>shotgunbukk Sir, I never said Rush SHOULD own anything. What I said was: I want to see him try 2 C if athletes would REALLY stand up."
"<at>cice75 Tell your son I said hey. And to focus on him jumpshot, DEFENSE and handling the basketball. Those 2 elements will get him far."
"<at>nmandarano Depends on the issue: If it's about their personal life, I'd try like hell not to. If it's about their performance, can't worry."

"<at>mrogi He damn sure should get some head-coaching job, soon."
"<at>cice75 Tell'em I said he has a great name. I'll have him on my show one day, okay?"
"<at>ConnorCompany OOOOOHHHHH, you are so right :)"
"<at>shotgunbukk Doesn't he earn his money legally? Doesn't he pay taxes? Ownership of a franchise shouldn't be contingent on whether someone is"
"<at>shotgunbukk liked!!! What should matter is whether or not he can cut the check. If he's so hated, then fans can boycott the team he owns."
"<at>numbskullgop I'm always in New York City."
"<at>RonaldDupree That's good to know. Feel free to educate me anytime you want, bro! I'm not above correction. Will always appreciate the"

"<at>cice75 Haaaa. Tell'em I said goodnight."
"<at>fleetwood78 Brett Favre and Brad Childress showed no class with the last touchdown. Totally uncalled for."
"<at>nmandarano There's always a sacrifice. Especially to your personal life. But, to me, it's been worth it."

"<at>numbskullgop Nope."
"<at>taylor824 Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

"<at>CEOLeeYarbo Ha Haaaaaaaaaaaaa. You've read my mind, bro!"
"<at>cice75 Tell'em I say good morning, and to make sure he works really hard in school."
"<at>fleetwood78 It was very, very classless. Which is what I'm about to say on the Stephen A. Smith Show on Fox Sports Radio RIGHT NOW."
"<at>CEOLeeYarbo They weren't celebrated the way Favre is. They EMBRACE their bad-boy image unapologetically. Favre feeds off the goody-2-shoes."
"<at>latilleon The second I'm officially invited by the masses, I'll be there. I like MEMPHIS."
"<at>celessa Deal with it, woman :)"
"<at>btheninger You just answered your own question, bruh!"

"<at>btheninger I can agree with that."
"<at>btheninger Is that a bad thing? There's lots to talk about."

"<at>DrKimmy Thank you, Dr. Kimmy. http://myloc.me/3aOIl"

"<at>Est_2_6_86 Thankyou. Enjoyed the experience. http://myloc.me/3aOPs"
"<at>libfreeamerica Not Flukes. Congratulations to the Jets. They just ran into the best QB...maybe in NFL History. Manning warrants that's ???"
"<at>cgrock24 I hear ya. How's the family?"
"<at>mrogi Yep."
"<at>fleetwood78 Yeah. But I'd never say. I don't talk about my colleagues."
"<at>fleetwood78 Still had a decent game, though."
"<at>D_Shogun The Republicans don't believe in the Health bill b/c they feel it'll raise the deficit. Combined with increased taxes, not good."
"<at>fleetwood78 Yes. Wow!"
"<at>Bamagirl_ I'm sure you don't feel that way now :)"
"<at>4n14 Sorry, babe. Would've been happy to do it."
"<at>MisterDuke2 Damn. Guess the Knicks were looking to go watch the Conference Championship Games."
"<at>suaven2g You keep doing that :)"

"<at>suaven2g Yes Sir."
"<at>speedroc I love the guy. Love his radio show. Even when I disagree with him, which is 50% of the time, I respect his passion/fearlessness."
"<at>Bamagirl_ I said Saints. Why has everyone asked me to repeat myself? :)"
"<at>stewnami Because I'm not going to. He's a former colleague. I don't like it at all, but nothing comes out of a former ESPN guy talking"
"<at>stewnami about someone who's still there. Looks bad, no matter how you slice it."
"<at>numbskullgop Nope."
"Minnesota looks unstoppable. The Saints had better figure out a way to stop them from moving the damn ball down the field."
"<at>LibranLove Neither do I."
"<at>passion4traveln Tell everyone there I said Hello and make sure they tune into my show on FoxSports Radio tomorrow. Also Sirius/XM 142"
"<at>stewnami The comment. Greenberg is a nice, class guy. But he was wrong her. That's all I'm willing to say."

"<at>Young_Sly We'll see."
"<at>miketotheg Thank God. About time."
"<at>aspera1163 That's my pick."

"<at>sugashayne3 That's exactly what I'm thinking."
"<at>kuhvet Thanks so much for telling me that. Really means a lot. Trying to have fun in the morning, ya know!"
"<at>bigbraz Similar to what Bush did in the National Championship game vs. Vince Young and Texas years back."
"<at>Leverman2010 The Inquirer REFUSES to publish my articles unless I agree to refrain from appearing on TV to discuss any non-sports-related"
"<at>Leverman2010 matters. They're attributed it to a Code of Ethics policy I've never seen in my 15 years at the paper. Not once."
"<at>aspera1163 Thank ya."
"<at>stroughter I have some conservative views. But I'm no Republican. I'm a FISCAL conservative; a social moderate."

"<at>mariestroughter I'd love to."
"<at>mrogi I hear ya."
"<at>josb146 Understood. Sorry you feel that way. But thanks for at least trying to listen. God Bless."
"Brett Favre is ridiculous sometimes. That's just one of the things I'm discussing this morning on the Stephen A. Smith Show. Arenas/Tebow 2"
"<at>LibranLove Thank ya, baby."
"For those of you who've listened to my show in the morning, do you think it's too strong? That I don't have enough fun? Because I'm lovin it"

"<at>Dabat0228 Paul Allen was great, wasn't he? :)"
"<at>musbdluv I'm mellowing out. But while doing so, I just wanted folks to know I'm going to always be ME. Keepin it as real as possible."
"<at>BookingBossDC Never do that. Waiting until the Super Bowl is over. Basketball will always be my first love. Just warming up. No worries"
"<at>NickTheOriginal Remind me tomorrow morning. Celessa has all that information. I'll make sure I get it to you while I'm on the show. Promise"
"<at>skeeweechik Please know, I don't say stuff because I ALWAYS have to be right. I say it b/c I BELIEVE I am right. And I always give folks"
"<at>skeeweechik an opportunity to prove me wrong. But why have a radio or tv show -- hell, a voice -- if I don't speak what I believe? Got to."
"<at>tallywineguy Thank you, my brother. I'll keep doing my best."
"<at>Drunkmuppets Sorry about that. Lots of calls and issues. Tweet me beforehand and call tomorrow and I'll have them put you on. Promise."

"<at>SCOTTGOHARD Thanks so much. And I couldn't agree with you more on Favre."

"<at>btheninger Okay. I'll let you know when I do."
"<at>caronjuelz Skip Bayless is my brother. One of my truest fans. We're very close and he ALWAYS wants me back. We both want it 5 days a wk."
"<at>btheninger From New York City. But ESPN would never put me and Skip together that much. Too much controversy. We'd scared everybody :)"
"<at>YoungTrale24 Bigger. More explosive. True, prototypical PG. Jennings is a scorer, quick and gifted. But not like Rose."
"<at>musbdluv I hear ya, my man. That's certainly always been my thinking."
"<at>BrandonTierney Always. Keep doing what you're doing. Put in a good word for you with Dave. He's a fantastic dude. Trust me on that."

"<at>ChrisJohnson143 I try to, my man."
"<at>FutureSportExec Is that right???"
"<at>Craig19802 I'll let you know in a week."
"<at>fleetwood78 Not the point. Perception is reality. The actions of the few damage the many. You need to learn to accept that."
"<at>SCOTTGOHARD I believe I took care of it. You tell me......since I'm sending you this tweet right now"
"<at>infoshaman Okay. So what r u trying to say?"
"<at>caneesq Who? Tell'em all to feel free to call into my show: 877-99-OnFOX."

"iHeartRadio.com is an application for iphones, blackberrys and iPods. You can download the application, and FoxSports Radio is 1 of the"

"<at>grahamzlaw Just sent it to everyone."
"<at>MisterMusik I believe it's 1340 AM"
"<at>Huemanxperience Everyone. Not fair to put it squarely on Favre's shoulders. But that interception was disgraceful."
"<at>CBIWNL I hear ya, Bruh!"
"<at>w_phipps That would be huge. That would be bad."
"<at>stevensinnott09 Absolutely. You've got to get better production from your juniors and seniors. Freshmen alone can't get ya National Title"

"<at>cice75 FoxSports Radio."
"<at>Splendiferous1 Great. Hope you listen."
"<at>TwinACMB Yes. I feel ya."
"<at>infoshaman I disagree. Non-sports people, per se, are at every game. They're the ones buying those season tickets. You'd be surprised how"
"<at>infoshaman fanatical they are about sports. It's shocking, but a lot of fun."
"<at>Drunkmuppets I just gave him some love."
"<at>BallersRadio Thank ya, Bro."
"<at>Woodleyb9 Gotta think about that a little bit. Maybe tomorrow."
"<at>MJP13 Great. Hope you're listening."

"<at>CjWashingtonjr Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
"<at>Est_2_6_86 That's what's up."
"<at>malenga Ha. Never heard of it. I don't know a damn thing about that kind of stuff."
"<at>MisterLJJR Nah. I'll have one soon."
"<at>Dholmes3682 New York's a better possibility."
"<at>wdenis1 Pro Bowl is a complete waste of time. Get rid of it."
"<at>peckerbreezy Thank you. Please feel free to spread the word. Thanks."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Yes I did."
"<at>Drunkmuppets I certainly try to. Thank you for noticing."
"<at>Woodleyb9 I'll try. Thanks for listening."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 that's what I like to hear."
"<at>ConsoleGam3r Thank you for listening."
"<at>MisterMusik Great."
"<at>HotSauceHustler No problem."
"<at>Drunkmuppets Tell him I TOLD YOU TO CALL....because you're a follower on Twitter. Then have him get directly in my ear. I'll handle it then"
"<at>Dholmes3682 A miracle. And the draft."
"<at>BRETTTHAHITMAN Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa."
"<at>BRETTTHAHITMAN Yes. You should go to the Podcast of my show and hear me and Vic the Brick this morning. Hilarious."
"<at>scott_Pitz As close as we can be as Journalist/Athlete."
"<at>jita1 You'll know in a week."
"<at>MykeMitch I really don't know, bro. I'll try and find out."
"<at>dre24811 Yep."
"<at>luckykeys I knnnnooooowwwwww"
"<at>luckykeys So do I."
"<at>KingArthur84 Thanks, Playa. Much appreciated."
"<at>mzjayme Thank ya baby. Hope you're well."
"<at>mrjones10 I Never said that about Downey. It's cruel of you to even say that lie. I said he's a BIGTIME talent, but his size is an issue."
"<at>pcola_boy They do have to if they want to get paid. That's all I'm saying. This is not some emotional thing. This is a point of fact."
"<at>btheninger Yes Sir."
"<at>Gaskill23 FoxSports Radio RIGHT NOW....6-to-9 a.m., re-aired on Sirius/XM Channel 142 from Noon-to-3 p.m. (EST)"
"<at>LaLaVuitton Yeah, I caught it. May touch on it a little bit."
"Tune into the Stephen A. Smith Show on Fox Sports Radio RIGHT NOW!!! I'm arguing with my girl, Celessa, about who Black Athletes better get"
"it together and recognize they've got to capitulate to White America in some fashion if they want to continue to get paid."
"<at>stevensinnott09 Nothing. He is in talks."
"<at>Kingtee10 Thanks, bro."
"<at>fleetwood78 Let'em hate."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 I tivoed it and watched it later."
"<at>cice75 WTF.....Pit Bull bite?"
"<at>lovelivedestiny That's America, baby."
"<at>Stevengilley15 Yep."
"<at>monkhood No. I'm saying the emotions are different,....not the punishments."
"<at>Huemanxperience I hear ya."
"<at>mrfollowme301 LeBron James. No need for an explanation."
"<at>BIG_SMALLS To some degree, YES!!! That is, ofcourse, unless you have another means of getting paid."
"<at>btheninger Gotcha."
"<at>pcola_boy It's not about changing who they are. It's about understanding you don't just get to do whatever you want w/o repercussions."
"<at>LibranLove Love it. Thank ya."
"<at>MikeHancho21 Feel free to call in: 877-99-ONFOX"
"<at>BobbyBroad He surpassed Favre years ago. Not even in the same class."
"<at>ecjr85 Ofcourse, everyone. I'm simply saying Blacks are held to a different standard in the court of public opinion."
"<at>chasecampbell1 I hear that."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Thanks, my man. She's Twitter.com/Celessa. Contact her there."
"<at>eipee73 Thanks, my man. Much appreciated."

"<at>Stevengilley15 I'm trying to, Boss."
"<at>lovelivedestiny Didn't want to. But apparently I have to."
"<at>lovelivedestiny Damn. Insulting a brother :)"
"<at>Zemrag_Skrap Bruh, I think you're FACTUALLY correct, as it pertains to punishment. But not fan reaction. That's different and more intense."
"<at>Zemrag_Skrap and I NEVER said Black Athletes get into more trouble. I said the reaction is more intense BECAUSE THEY ARE BLACK."
"<at>Zemrag_Skrap It makes sense and you know it. You're intelligent brother. Stop acting like you're head is in the sand. Rules are different."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Thanks, bro. Appreciate the love."
"<at>Zemrag_Skrap I'll touch on that tomorrow for you. No problem."
"<at>MisterRudolph Amen."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 I don't have the answer that question. You know the answer."
"<at>Zemrag_Skrap If facts were not accentuate with opinions, you wouldn't be listening, bro. Conversations would not exist."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Amen. That's why I'm here. I'll always do at least that. That much I can promise you."
"<at>Zemrag_Skrap Now.....tell me why all we've heard about is TEBOW??? You've officially answered your own questions. God Bless, my brother."
"<at>Woodleyb9 Interesting news story. That's all. Nothing else."
"<at>JohnThornton Thanks, Bro."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 To some degree. They're the few that's marketed by the NFL."

"<at>lovelivedestiny Yes Lawd!!!"
"<at>MisterRudolph <at>rogerbonair I hear ya, babe."
"<at>Soulful1 I never questioned that. All I said was the reaction is different and Black players better know that. I can't believe ur denying"
"<at>Est_2_6_86 I didn't think so."
"<at>bulldurham60 All around us."
"<at>Soulful1 I hear ya."
"<at>FAMUAce I totally agree with you. Just tired of us hurting ourselves due to pride that gets us nowhere."
"<at>BRETTTHAHITMAN gotcha"
"<at>EkosDeux Amen!"
"<at>s919rider Sorry you feel that way. All I was saying is that the Black Athlete can't continue to do what they want while needing support"
"<at>dvickery6 Sorry you feel that way, Bro."
"<at>Soulful1 not that I know of"
"<at>cice75 I'm really, really sorry to hear all of that. Please let him know lots of folks are praying for him."
"<at>scott_Pitz They'd like to, but most teams don't want to spend, including Houston."
"<at>gilldathrill The type of stuff I can't repeat :-)"
"<at>s919rider I hear you!"
"<at>dvickery6 no problem. I'm hear for ya :-)"
"<at>FAMUAce I hear ya. And I appreciate you agreeing with me"
"<at>mariestroughter It was decent, but he needs to follow thru with those Capital Gains Tax cuts for small businesses"
"<at>Soulful1 Yes Sir!"
"<at>EkosDeux I agree."
"<at>lovelivedestiny the ""MJ""???"
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Stay tuned, my man. A lot of happening. you don't know where I'll be it the next couple of months. Keep listening."
"And BTW...let's be clear about something: It's a morning show.  I'm a hardcore sports guy,  so 90 percent of any show I do will ALWAYS be on"
"Sports. But there's nothing wrong with taking a break from it for a few minutes to talk about what's going on outside the world of Sports."
"<at>KarlMoorebay Might not be a bad idea."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Yeah. But the fans have a right to select who they want."
"<at>SpyderD Evidently not :)"
"<at>pcola_boy Ain't that something."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Always good to flirt. All in fun. Trust me,....I don't mess around where I eat."
"<at>LibranLove Thank you, my dear. I'll be good with my Grammy picks. As for Vick, nothing will hurt his image worse. Damage already done."
"<at>stevensinnott09 Can't say how much I appreciate all of my fans. Means a lot to me that ya'll support me."

"<at>Est_2_6_86 Done!"
"<at>FantomFresh21 Yes Sir."
"<at>FARRAH1228 Thanks for the love, baby."
"<at>luckykeys It's ALWAYS mostly about Sports. Always."
"<at>gibraltar06 Why Bro? What's the need for a podcast when I'm doing the whole show? Just asking!"
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Thanks, my man."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 That's exactly where I was going to go, but I was running out of time."
"<at>HotSauceHustler My pleasure."
"<at>luckykeys Thank you so much. Means a lot to hear you say that. I've never done Morning Radio before. I haven't had one night w/ more than 3"
"<at>luckykeys hours sleep yet. So it's a struggle. But I didn't want to run from the challenge. Wanted to see how I handled this. Fans love it."
"<at>luckykeys All I can do is hope the love continues flowing."
"<at>LibranLove Hell No. Not into embarrassing myself :)"
"<at>CoveThug Gracias! :-)"
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Huh? What are you talking about?"
"<at>notoococky Shiiiiiittttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not about to embarrass myself like that."

"<at>djscorpia Thank ya."
"<at>numbskullgop Call 877-99-ONFOX"
"<at>TheFakeFan Yeah! Celessa brought that up. But let's not overreact. We talked about it for 2 minutes. Calm down."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Yes Sir."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 I hear ya, my man :)"
"<at>CCC1 Thank ya."
"<at>notoococky Hell-to-the-Naaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
"<at>urbanREUP I've noticed the hypocrisy myself, Bruh! It is what it is."
"<at>notstephenA I hear ya Bro!"
"<at>SCOTTGOHARD Amen, Bruh!"
"<at>GregorySmall Thanks, Bruh!!!"
"<at>clbernal Not wise"
"<at>scott_Pitz Who cares!"
"Hope everyone's enjoying their weekend. I finally get a day to relax before heading down to Miami for Super Bowl Week."
"<at>mrjones10 I admit when I've made mistakes when I've ACTUALLY made them. But I will NEVER accept responsibility for what I DID NOT SAY."
"<at>mrogi quite possible."
"<at>mrogi don't bother going there"
"<at>PhillyT2LA I agree with Carmen. Philly can win if they get D-Nabb a durable quality back and a big-time receiver with some size."
"<at>Sean_Anthony Thanks Sean. Please spread the word."
"<at>pcola_boy no doubt"
"<at>MistressFab Amen to that!"
"How about the fact that Kentucky is not only running Vandy out the building, but they're shutting down this kid Ogilvy. Impressive."
"<at>princeofthe217 I agree. It's not too hard. I've seen the kid a couple of times and, quite honestly, I'm not that impressed."
"<at>dougkeklak Feel free to look at it that way all you want, b/c I certainly don't. I've been on the air for 3 weeks talking sports. That's"
"<at>dougkeklak not someone giving the show a chance. That's someone making the decision not the carry the show BEFORE I EVER ARRIVED. It's also"
"<at>dougkeklak their perogative. Here's a lesson for you, though: you don't get anywhere in life rooting for someone else's demise. God Bless"
"<at>scott_Pitz Who Cares!"
"<at>mickheck54 nah! They're in it until Elite 8"
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Yes Sir!!!"
"<at>polechulo I'm thinking Kansas or Syracuse or Villanova."
"<at>FutureSportExec I definitely applaud that :-)"
"<at>soulonice6 I appreciate that, my man. I've never encountered so many problems. IHeart! Internet! Local signals! Hard to explain."
"<at>speedroc They were, but now we have to see if it's just rhetoric on his part."
"<at>dougkeklak Fine! You're completely entitled to your opinion, which I respect. But there are many people who disagree with you, as I'm sure"
"<at>dougkeklak you know. I'm not Czaban. Don't know him; never met him. I wish him well. Don't wish for anyone to fail. I sincerely hope he's"
"<at>dougkeklak doing his thing. I wish you well, too. But just because you have an opinion about my talent doesn't mean there are not those who"
"<at>dougkeklak would vehemently disagree. I know my style is not for everybody, but we'll see what happens. I wish Czaban and all his fans well"
"<at>dougkeklak Just wish those same fans would show me the same courtesy. I had nothing to do with his departure. Folks need to contact FOX"
"<at>dougkeklak about that. All the best to you and yours."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Lakers/Celtics."
"<at>scott_Pitz Again, who cares?"
"<at>VasChosenOne Appreciate the love, my man. I'm just determined to love folks until they love me back. It's good. Got 2 respect his feelings"
"<at>scott_Pitz I hear ya, Dawg."
"<at>numbskullgop Just arrived in Miami, peoples!"

"Ladies learn how to treat the guys who seem like they love something more than them. I'm here for ya (smile!!!!). But ladies, I won't leave"
"Ya'll behind :-)"

"Holler<at>StephenA.com. I'll try to pick a letter each weekday to read on my show. Welcome your newest Dr. Phil (Smile!!!) I'm gonna love this."
"<at>illakiladelph Patience, my friend. It's all coming soon enough."
"<at>illakiladelph Loved it."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Haaaaaaaaa. Let'em come."
"<at>pcola_boy Good analogy."
"<at>pcola_boy Damn near. Pretty pathetic."
"<at>passion4traveln I'm listening."
"<at>YUNGFATS Thanks, bro."
"<at>JAWS63 Nope. You should've divorced them years ago."
"<at>yh84 Damn Skippy."
"<at>illakiladelph I'm here for ya :)"
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Wouldn't go that far. My intent isn't to piss people off. It's just to let'em know I'm going to be as real as it gets."
"<at>MDW21 Didn't ya just heard me. I just said the Celtics aren't even in my Top-5 anymore."
"<at>BobbyBroad Can't blame you for that."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Amen."
"<at>camm23 Haaaaaa. Thanks, bro."
"<at>MisterMusik Go to Holler<at>StephenA.com"
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Thanks, bro."
"<at>Splendiferous1 Once we get it started, that's the plan. May do it tomorrow."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 He's the real deal."
"<at>BobbyBroad I said Rodney Harrison corrected me."
"<at>numbskullgop Don't know yet."
"<at>ninnles Words of Wisdom, I assume."
"<at>cice75 Haaaaaaaaa. A man who forces you to make a choice usually loses. If a woman loves you enough, he doesn't have to make you choose."
"<at>numbskullgop I just tweeted you a few minutes ago."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 We go back a long, long ways."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Very High Risk."
"<at>Hershell_ yes Sir. I know. I covered Temple at the time."
"<at>SultryBeauty Very interesting."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Screw them. He plays the game."
"<at>CelticKiller562 Charlotte is tough, my man. And like I told you: Larry Brown is one of the GREATEST COACHES of all time."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Always."
"<at>CelticKiller562 That's the thing. I don't know if Garnett will get healthy."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Nope. He barely needs another one now."
"<at>CelticKiller562 Celtics are not healthy. That's why I changed my pick. KG is NOT HEALTHY."
"<at>JAWS63 Steelers"
"<at>DragonflyJonez Yes I did."
"<at>JAWS63 Whatcha talking about???"
"<at>Deshair may take you up on that."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 You're right! They are two separate things. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
"<at>numbskullgop Feel free. Looking forward to it."
"<at>BobbyBroad I hear ya, Bro!"
"<at>JAWS63 They're PATHETIC. But I admire you're loyalty."
"<at>JAWS63 Yeeeeeaaaahhhhhh! Whatever :-)"
"<at>cice75 it's all about prioritizing. There's a time for your man and a time for football. It's your responsibility to know when -- IF u want"
"<at>cice75 to keep your man. If he doesn't matter, then it doesn't matter what you do."
"<at>stevensinnott09 I have no idea. Sorry."
"<at>fleetwood78 Yes, it would. I'm going to make that pitch tomorrow."
"<at>TheFakeFan What are you talking about?"
"<at>Deshair That's great, bro."
"<at>JAWS63 Thanks, my man. Appreciate the love."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Both."
"<at>LibranLove Good morning."
"<at>bigmixxx Yep."
"<at>stevensinnott09 Yeah. Would've been nice to see him with Walls."
"<at>fleetwood78 Yes he did."
"<at>CEOLeeYarbo What do you mean?"
"<at>mariestroughter Haaaaaaa."
"<at>BobbyBroad Certainly sounds like it."
"<at>papakojo True. But he's in no position to be leaning on inaccurate reports when he's the one who gave credence to all the B.S."
"<at>CEOLeeYarbo It probably is. There's nothing I can do about it. I've been on the air for 3 weeks. Folks are loving the show. Others who have"
"<at>CEOLeeYarbo an agenda and want to pull me off the air are folks with their own agenda. Let'em do what they're going to do."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Always."
"<at>Tongadude I'm about to talk Kobe right now."
"<at>WhoIsMoJey Thanks, bro."
"<at>papakojo We are. Just stating facts."
"<at>Tongadude If it were to happen, yes. But it won't. I can promise you that."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 A problem I live with every single day."
"<at>papakojo Haaaaaaaaaaaaa. Say it loud and proud, dawg :)"
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Thanks, bro."
"<at>HotSauceHustler Appreciate the compliment."
"<at>Tongadude He's not the greatest Laker of all time. That's all I'm saying."
"<at>BobbyBroad Amen."
"<at>Tongadude I can guarantee you, Kobe will not win 7 rings. Not 6 either, unless he gets traded to a team with another superstar."
"<at>WhoIsMoJey Appreciate ya, bro."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Thanks, my man. Make sure you're spreading the words to folks."
"<at>pcola_boy Yes Laaawwwwddddd."
"<at>pcola_boy Haaaaaaa."
"<at>MrMacBlack They'll make the finals this year."
"<at>MrMacBlack SOOOOOOOOOO."
"<at>notstephenA NOPE. NOT yet. but they need to give me a endorsement deal :)"
"<at>coach4lyfe Hey Ted, email me at Holler<at>StephenA.com"
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Aight! Glad to know you're good. And thanks for the compliments on the interviews."
"<at>GMUPatriot13 Sir, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't see every single tweet. Sorry."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 It's good. But i just focus on doing a good job. Interviews like Brown make it easy.  The real test, though, is doing boring 1's"
"<at>pcola_boy Hell No I won't."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Yes Sir."
"<at>FreeKnowledge10 Appreciate the love, my man."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 The man can coach. Plain and simple."
"<at>Tongadude No. He has everything he needs. If the Cavs don't win it all, LeBron needs to look at himself -- and coach Brown. Simple as that."
"<at>GMUPatriot13 I do not have it, sir. Sorry. But I'm sure YouTube has it somewhere."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 No sir."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 Thank ya. Much appreciated."
"<at>gibraltar06 We're working on it. I'll tweet when all of that stuff is up. They're incredibly busy during SB week, so it'll have to wait."
"<at>christine1doll Yes sir. Just as SB week. Once it's over, I'll be back in action."
"Question: What do all of ya'll think of me starting my VERY OWN NBA SHOW on the internet in a few weeks????"

"<at>Est_2_6_86 I hear ya."
"<at>Mic_Myers Who knows what the future holds, Bro."
"<at>bowla300game Thank you, sir."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 IT's why I already counted them out. They're injured. They can't beat Cleveland unless they're 100 percent. Sorry."
"<at>ShomitMukherjee NO help needed. But I appreciate the offer."
"<at>ShomitMukherjee Yes Sir. In conjuction with USTREAM."
"<at>joseph604 I guess. I just miss talking about the NBA, so thought I'd do it."
"<at>fleetwood78 I plan to."
"<at>jcr4522 Thank ya."
"<at>brickben Thank ya."
"<at>pingnepo I hope Mayweather beats him."

"<at>pepey24 Lakers for now. But Denver's coming. The Nuggets would win the West if they still had Marcus Camby."
"<at>GMUPatriot13 What in the hell are you talking about."
"<at>basketball4u Ha Haaaaaaa."
"<at>Hoptimus_Prime I'd definitely have my shine :)"
"<at>CLEGOP So will I. They should win it all."

"<at>GMUPatriot13 long-ass tweet is kind of sick, if you ask me. You really need to check yourself into someplace."
"<at>CaramelButtafly Thank you sooooooo much. Deeply appreciate the support"
"<at>GMUPatriot13 sorry you feel that way. Have a nice life. God Bless"
"<at>pcola_boy thanks bro."
"<at>Crazy_SexC_Cool thanks, my man."
"<at>trife76 actually, I do right now."
"<at>fleetwood78 Don't believe they should. He's innocent until proven."
"<at>DJKNUCKLEZ haaaaaaa."
"<at>pingnepo I love both fighters. But I do believe Floyd has a right to be suspicious about Pacquaio."
"<at>Katrenia Tell her to email me at Holler<at>StephenA.com"
"<at>musbdluv Colts 38-34"
"<at>tsb2000 nothing"
"<at>DJKNUCKLEZ No Sir. Maybe tomorrow night, though"
"<at>cosmosherry Because Pacquaio has moved up 7 weight classes in his career and is carrying power with him. Love the dude, but I'm suspicious"
"<at>ElGalloGigante I didn't say Pacquaio is cheating. I'm saying Floyd has a right to be suspicious."
"<at>pingnepo I'd have doubts, too. Manny looks stronger against bigger guys than he did vs. The small ones. Very suspicious."
"<at>Crazy_SexC_Cool Thank you dear. Appreciate the love"
"<at>coltcrazie5521 Thanks my man. Appreciate the support very much."
"<at>fleetwood78 The Greatest Receiver of All-Time"

"<at>hockeylady99 Thank you for noticing."
"<at>theactualtodd Haaaaaaaaaaaa. I'll take it as a compliment, my man. Thanks so much."
"<at>georgeelevate All of it's very alarming. Guilt or innocence, you've got to watch yourself. And there are women hell-bent on $$$. Trust no 1"
"<at>ShaunAhmad Loving my morning show on foxSports Radio. Loving it! Thanks for listening. I'm on Sirius/XM, too, channel 142 6-to-9 and 12-3"

"<at>Gocats5411 Thanks, my man."
"<at>GMUPatriot13 Does anything make sense in the world of sports, these days? Come on!"
"<at>Travis_Wade Who???"
"<at>soulonice6 You'll need a better reason than that. They'll need Divine Intervention to stop Peyton Manning."
"<at>numbskullgop Indy: 38-34 or 41-31....haven't really decided on the score yet."
"<at>Gocats5411 I'm loving it."
"<at>Travis_Wade If they can get him they should go for it. They've got nothing to lose, even if he doesn't want to stay after this season."
"After needing a Police Escort, then security, to get in the stadiums -- b/c fans were mobbing me for pics - I am here at Super Bowl XLIV."
"I've got to admit I'm absolutely shocked. I expected a shootout. But give the Saints' offense credit. They've kept Manning off the field."
"<at>NANY83 I try to be, baby. Thanks for the support."
"<at>passion4traveln Already did it :)"
"<at>mzjayme Ha Haaaaaa. I'm coming for my Massage Therapy soon enough."
"<at>DJ_Flair You had me until you mentioned Brett ""Hit Man"" Hart. Ric Flair was better. And what about Magnum T.A., Dusty Rhodes and Macho Man?"
"<at>jordanrbass Totally serious. It was ridiculous."
"<at>LaVern25 I am now."
"<at>thesportshater So am I. But at least you know me. I'm flattered :)"
"<at>totonogrisales Nah! Never feel that way. Got nothing but love for my peeps. Was just trying to get to the game, though."
"<at>mariestroughter Don't get in trouble with your man, sweety. I'm not worth that :)"
"<at>rhf22 I try my best."
"<at>LeibyMan Ask ESPN. I don't work for them anymore. Can't do anything on their network unless they ask for me."
"<at>MisterLJJR Freeney is doing the damn thang :)"

"This is the moment for PEYTON MANNING. Right here! Right now! 5:42 left. We're about to find out if he's one of the greatest ever, or......."
"<at>gymfan09 Manning is still great. Still a Hall of Famer. But his luster definitely lost a little of it's shine. Sorry!"
"<at>atomicdog1911 if you think Michael Vick is one of the greatest ever.......you're banned from Tweeting me"
"<at>HandsBro50 Yeah! I knooooowwwwwww :-)"
"<at>HandsBro50 You Should! I deserve it."
"<at>JimDuncanlll <at>StephenASmith Not true! I have no love for the Colts. I just never believed Saints' Defense would be able to hold'em to 17."
"<at>Dabat0228 Neither can I"
"<at>HotSauceHustler Wouldn't go that far. Braves went to postseason 14 straight years and have just 1 ring"
"<at>jmo310 of course"
"<at>btheninger I hear he proposed last night"
"<at>mrogi I know this"
"<at>IAMSY yes maam."

"<at>btheninger Completely correct"
"<at>mrogi Didn't see that."
"<at>mrogi I totally agree"
"<at>magikwurd It absolutely does for me."
"<at>JimDuncanlll Yes Sir"
"Btw.....I'm officially back writing columns for the Philadelphia Inquirer. My 1st column is in today's paper on the 76ers. Check it out"

"<at>Skewerman Go to Philly.Com. I'll have it up on my website today"
"<at>iconjohn I hear ya. That's just my frustration coming out over how bad this situation truly is."
"<at>papakojo Haaaa. You gotta admit I sounded smooth, though :-)"
"<at>papakojo Uuuuhhhhh! Damn! You hurt my feelings :-)"

"<at>pcola_boy ridiculous"
"<at>BobbyBroad Yes Sir. He does. No disrespect to Floyd Little."
"<at>pcola_boy Yes Sir. I agree."
"<at>btheninger Yes he is. From an historical perspective, considering what he endured to get to become a Head Coach, that's bigger than f-ball."
"<at>Est_2_6_86 We agree."
"<at>ScoopB Thank you. Happy to have met you."
"<at>taniarbwtgn7 Thanks, my man."
"<at>BobbyBroad I can't take his outfits."

"Feel free to email me at Holler<at>StephenA.com. Tweet me right here or just feel free to call in: 877-99-ONFOX. Looking forward to it."
"Ooops....I forgot. I'm about to have Michael Vick on the show at 7:30 EST. Just so ya'll know."
"<at>AmadoALLDAY They didn't tank it. They just lost."
"<at>netta1019AIFAN He's with his daughter, who's sick."
"<at>RehemaEDUTAINER Perhaps you're right, my dear :)"
"<at>RehemaEDUTAINER That's not an addiction, my dear. That's being a man."
"<at>brothafrmanotha Thanks, my man. Appreciate you saying that."
"<at>Brendan_Nelson Nope. It would still be Brady or Peyton Manning. Stronger arms with more height."
"<at>tall_mic I have no explanation for that. That's why I've gone off about it."
"<at>Brendan_Nelson Yeah. But they're very impressive. And Kevin Durant is a SuperStar."
"<at>LibranLove That you sooooooooooooo much, sweetheart. Deeply appreciate the support. Means a lot. Spread the word to your girls."
"<at>LaShuan Please. I don't believe that for one second."
"<at>LaShuan But do me a favor and feel free to invite all of your girls to call into the show. I don't want my show to be just about the fellas"
"<at>Brendan_Nelson The Hawks are NOT beating Cleveland. You can scratch that dream....although I'd love to be wrong...just to be in ATL."
"<at>Brendan_Nelson They can beat Kentucky. Doubt they can beat Kansas. Then again, Syracuse can get it done."
"<at>LaShuan Not with Flacco as their QB. Sorry."
"<at>Brendan_Nelson Possibly, but unlikely."
"<at>TheKidSquints Yes. FoxSportsRadio.com RIGHT NOW!!! Click on LIVE."

"<at>bolastname Whatcha talking about, Bro?"
"<at>mrogi Stop embarrassing yourself"

"<at>PRYMETYMEJ3 This would be correct :)"
"<at>ACrowe21 Cincinnati appears interested. We'll see."

"<at>Leverman2010 Weak"
"<at>fleetwood78 He is better than Ray Allen."
"<at>fleetwood78 Clearly, the Mavs got better and the Wizards got work. Blame Gilbert Arenas. He's ruined that franchise for a time now."
"<at>mrogi He's entitled to his opinions."
"<at>1mwalker It's legit."
"<at>soulonice6 Appreciate the support, bruh! Thanks a bunch."
"<at>lelandyarnell Tiring."
"<at>TheBlueScreen enjoyed it. Thanks"
"<at>soulonice6 hmmmmmm."

"<at>lelandyarnell Thanks Bruh!"
"<at>califromdabay yep!"
"<at>bigbraz That's an easier answer. You're just not thinking."
"<at>wdenis1 Terrible idea. These players are marketed as the best in the world. If they lose to street hustlers, credibility is shot."
"<at>BobbyBroad Thank you, Bruh! Means a lot to me to hear you say that. Seriously. Thank you."
"<at>Hahnhead Thanks bruh! Much love. I'd love to see my man Calipari win a National Title."
"<at>pcola_boy Oh Stop It! :-)"
"<at>BobbyBroad Probably not. But the ""We Are The World Remake"" for Haiti Relief certainly makes up for it."

"<at>Byron_Watkins Thanks, Bruh!"
"<at>passion4traveln it Sucked"
"<at>nflgossipgirl no Maam."
"<at>BobbyBroad Nope! Worse. He was damn hysterical. I loved it, though. That's my man and it was all love and fun. I knew someone would get me."
"<at>wdenis1 Hell, I've got one better. I DID better dunks like that in the same park. That's where I'm from, remember :-)"
"<at>passion4traveln Yep. Waste of time."

"<at>HotSauceHustler No problem."

"<at>Travis_Bush PR folks who don't give a damn about you. Man Up!!!"
"<at>LoreleiRachelle Hey! Hey!"
"<at>bsherrer That's not the issues with the Sportswriters. Their issue is Tiger's repeated attempts to always avoid answering for what he does."
"<at>bsherrer He's wrong. You can't be in the public eye and does what he does. If it happened to me, I'd have to answer questions. Period!"
"<at>mzjayme Thank you. Babygirl!"
"<at>Leverman2010 God Awful"
"<at>mlwilliford That is correct"
"<at>sefog I've done a whole lotta shit wrong. Some of it similar to Tiger. But I don't run. And I wouldn't hesitate to tell folks to mind their"

"<at>jlang_hitkiller so I've heard."
"<at>DinyelleNichol I didn't run over her"
"<at>DanaKing70 Thanks for the compliment :-)"

"<at>KingHasani1 Fame without fortune SUCKS"

"<at>BillyDMillions Save the Black Shit! Not one single Black person was amongst Tiger's ""Loved Ones or Friends"" and you're questioning"
"<at>BillyDMillions MY BLACKNESS. Please!"
"<at>BillyDMillions Whatever!"
"<at>BillyDMillions I disagree. Don't think it was over the top at all b/c I wasn't judging his situation w/ his wife. I was on him for being"
"<at>BillyDMillions fake and disingenuous. He tries to contril everything instead of just being real. I don't respect that. Period."
"<at>BillyDMillions I don't cover Golf, so you assertion has zero validity"

"<at>MonteSchisler Thanks, my man."
"<at>CajuNinja Thank ya."
"<at>NFL_DIVA Thank you, my dear!"
"<at>emeraldjane Actually, yes I am because it's MY JOB to have opinions -- earned over the course of a 17-year Journalism career. Plus, I am"
"<at>emeraldjane not getting on Tiger b/c of his adulterous affairs. Absolutely none of my business. Just don't respect how he's tried to"
"<at>emeraldjane hoodwink everyone and totally control the environment. Man Up! Face the music. Don't be a punk. That's my issue with him."
"<at>NFL_DIVA yes Maam!"
"<at>KingHasani1 Your lips to God's ears."

"<at>Deshair I'm to the point where Durant is one of my top-2 choices for league MVP Honors."
"<at>BillyDMillions Well, my opinion is what counts TO ME...just like you're opinion is what counts to you. Just b/c I said what I feel doesn't"
"<at>BillyDMillions mean someone else has to adopt that belief. And if they do, that's on them. My obligation is to be real and straight about"

"I hope ya'll listen to my closing remarks on the Stephen A. Smith Show this morning. I've been called a Sell-Out. I'm not having that. It's"

"<at>Supernola1 Cower. I have not problem standing up in public and telling folks to go-to-HELL and mind their own damn business. He should've."
"<at>papakojo I pretty much have. But I've got some funny footage of folks crying over him."

"<at>MMTheRook Got it. And I agree."
"<at>TJ73Mustang Oh, No Sir! I didn't SOUL OUT. ESPN let me go. What was I suppose to do? Remain unemployed? Sorry, not gonna happen."
"<at>trc7880 Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa."
"<at>trc7880 True. I do like Brandon Marshall more."
"<at>MrESPN Thanks. I miss Skip, too. Durant is 2nd to me for league MVP honors to LeBron. But he's easily one of the top-5 players. SENSATIONAL"
"<at>MMTheRook No Thank you, sir. Appreciate the request."
"<at>GokeyBell Thanks. But the fact remains A.I. is not what he use to be. No body loves that brother more than me, but He's lost a big step."
"<at>jaysherby They should, because it'll help them recruit."

"<at>trc7880 Why. You won't miss much."
"<at>jrthebossman I hear ya."
"<at>mrogi Kornheiser is NOT in any category like that. He made a remark he should not have, trying to be funny. But don't ever say that about"
"<at>mrogi him. He's one of the best people I know; just not shy about saying what he feels, especially if it gets a laugh. He'll be back."
"<at>fleetwood78 Life is different for a QB than it is for a running back."
"<at>fleetwood78 EXACTLY"
"<at>mrogi Yes it was. He should not have said that. But he just mis-spoke, that's all. Still a damn good man...and a Friend."
"<at>gator81 Well damnit, they haven't done a good enough job, evidently."
"<at>KRUZECONTROL I love my brother, A.I. It hurt to write that today in the Philly Inquirer. But I had no choice. Gotta call it like I see it."

"I've also said Kevin Durant is one of the top-4 players in the game. He's officially a SuperStar. Just off the charts. The 2nd-coming of"
"The Iceman, George Gervin. Just ridiculous."
"<at>taylor824 That would be smart."
"<at>BryceThinksThat Yo! I don't know how we can deny it. The kid's a SUPERSTAR. And D-Wade's J is not on that level."
"<at>btoporek I did no such thing. Please be accurate. I said it's totally understandable, but that he's lost a step. He's not what he use to be"
"<at>raplikeTHEORY So do I. But it'll happen. It's good to have a year off to reflect."
"<at>TZEIGLER24 Thanks, bro."
"Another day, another lie told about me. My closing remarks today will be on Allen Iverson. I'll set the record straight then."
"<at>pcola_boy Yep. Finally!"
"<at>Dromr Thank you."
"<at>crasie671 Like him a lot. But he's not on Durant's level. Not at all."

"<at>GMUPatriot13 They could make a case for it, but I doubt it'll happen."

"<at>MaynMan1 Are you really telling me that's not a bit suspicious?"
"<at>Millien4life About what?"
"<at>Millien4life there's nothing RIDICULOUS about what Mayweather said about Pacman. It may NOT be true. But it's not ridiculous."
"<at>SpyderD I feel you. Thank you for reminding me of that. BUT STILL.....how is most of America going to see that??? U know Vick can't afford"
"<at>illakiladelph Don't know if I can do that. Sorry."
"<at>Dromr Thanks, bro."
"<at>nflgossipgirl I am. That's why I just mentioned it, but didn't talk much about it. He's the biggest. Not much went on in sports last night."
"<at>illakiladelph He wasn't the only one, my man. Not accurate to say that."
"<at>illakiladelph I have not killed TIGER. What are you talking about?"
"<at>illakiladelph Yo! I'm not dogging the Show, at all. I support those brothers. I'm just saying VICK can't have that look right now."
"<at>MaynMan1 Sorry you feel that way. My career and willingness to call out ANYBODY speaks for itself. Sorry u feel the need to bring Race up."
"<at>Millien4life And by the way, Sugar Shane Moseley is a pretty damn big fight."
"<at>Millien4life No! Not for us. But it IS okay for a undefeated, world champion to bring it up. It's Mayweather's PROFESSION. He's entitled."
"<at>SCOTTGOHARD I didn't give Bush a pass. But I do recognize that two catastrophies took place on his watch. Billions were spent b/c of it."
"<at>SWITCH_PROD Thanks, bro."
"<at>streethistory No! Dumb that he would mention that when the Eagles are about to keep him in Philly."
"Sugar Shane Moseley's, the reignin WBA Welterweight Champion, is about to come on the Stephen A. Smith Show right now."

"<at>mrogi Let's not speak ill of the dead, my man. Let Upshaw rest in peace."
"<at>passion4traveln Not a damn thing."
"<at>JoeShmo123 No. I believe the Knicks have turned him off."
"<at>DaneDem Kobe was a better talent. MJ was a better winner."
"<at>JustinAveryBFK Dallas, Miami or New York."
"<at>notoococky No way in HELL. I'm not embarrassing myself."
"<at>njfuture I absolutely love Stan Van Gundy as a coach...especially during interviews."
"<at>chasingphoto If you want to put it that way, that's on you. I just look at the system and know there's a bunch of guys cheating."

"<at>BobbyBroad Agreed."
"<at>Monic4G Neither can I."

"<at>MrCantDoBetter Evidently, you've only listened to 5 minutes of the show because I've been talking about 10 other subjects since. LISTEN!!!!"
"<at>jwells1914 Yeah! But it's not funny for Vick. That's what you're missing."
"<at>SWITCH_PROD I'd pick Floyd by decision."
"<at>Supernola1 Come on, Bruh! Save that real shit for another day. You and I both know Vick is on thin ice. Plus, he's broke. He doesn't need"
"<at>Supernola1 to put himself in any kind of compromising positions. Period. Stop thinking about what you'd do AWAY from the spotlight."
"<at>IamReggieBaby Thanks, my brother. Appreciate the love."
"<at>Woodleyb9 Usually a good thing because that means he was given an offer. Unless, ofcourse it's the NFL and a player doesn't want it."
"<at>DJDrama Yo! Just wanted to congratulate you on the Vick interview. I was critical of him because of stuff TOTALLY UNRELATED to you guys."
"<at>DJDrama Just wanted you to hear that from me personally. No hatin' whatsoever going on this way, bro. Great job. Wish u the best. Peace!"

"<at>therealdjheat thanks bro."
"<at>36Snuggles Hey! Hey! Hey!"
"<at>ACEisenstein Sir, am I wrong to assume you can read English? I column evolved around the manner in which they're handling McNabb, primarily"
"<at>ACEisenstein Those were my words. If you're going to get on me, at least be accurate."
"<at>36Snuggles You're welcome."
"<at>Broadnax757 I'd love to do it. I asked HBO if I could do Friday Night Fights more than a year ago, but it never happened. Oh well."

"<at>OntheDLpodcast Whatever you say, bruh!"
"<at>RobPugs717 Thanks, my man."
"Btw....I just want on my show and asked this question: How is it that Tebow is being mentioned as a possible 1st-rounder, while McNabb can't"
"get traded for anything higher than a second-round pick? Does someone NOT see something wrong with this picture???"
"<at>DiioiaBeats Trade McNabb to a quality team and admit you're rebuilding. Don't act like you've got a better shot at a SB with Kolb.INSULTING"
"<at>Brendan_Nelson Is the PROSPECT of Tebow worth more than the reality of McNabb? Don't think so."
"<at>TLanceB Not good enough. Try again."
"<at>Travis_Bush I hear ya."
"<at>LovelyNursetoBe Amen, Nurse Betty :-)"
"<at>lakerfan622 They haven't shot down the rumors. What they've said is the offers haven't been attractive enough. Diminishing McNabb's value."
"<at>_Remixx Catastrophy in the making."
"<at>OntheDLpodcast Please explain what you mean by ""amazingly how different I write?"" Thank you."
"<at>IMCHOPPERSOSA Good luck with that, bro!"

"<at>abuthejuiceman Huh? Whatcha talking about?"
"<at>KRUZECONTROL I hear ya."
"<at>BillyDMillions Not quite that simple. Tebow's character has an awful lot to do with it."

"<at>Matt_McGilicuty Good points."
"<at>T_Woodbury Appreciate ya, bro."
"<at>SpikeRocks Please!!!"
"<at>DaveHuberEsq Don't speak for me. That's not how I feel. Give me a better option and McNabb can leave. But don't tell me it's Kolb."
"<at>JGAphoto FoxSports Radio.com. OR......Sirius/XM Channel 142, also re-aired from Noon-to-3 pm EST..OR StephenASmithShow.com."
"<at>jjcurcio You gotta ask ESPN about that. My TV rights are wide-open. If they wanted me back they could get me"
"<at>SpikeRocks Huh???"
"<at>CEOLeeYarbo Something wrong with what picture???"
"<at>illakiladelph Not true. You're not listening. Your ASS...uming! Stop it."
"<at>The_Viper1 Thanks, Bro!"

"<at>SpikeRocks Was he coming to Philly any other time? Stop being a damn idiot! Every column/story can't be breaking news. Sometimes, the"
"<at>SpikeRocks obvious needs to be said"
"<at>CBIWNL I'm good homie. How have you been."
"The Stephen A. Smith Show is about to begin, folks. I was on Larry King Live last night. I'll be talking WOMEN, NFL, NBA and Final-Four."
"Btw....I'll be back on LARRY KING LIVE on Monday night, as well as ""The Ed Show"" on MSNBC, following Tiger's media session. But not before:"
"I'll appear on THE VIEW Monday night with Whoopi, Barbara Walters, Joy Behar, Cheryl Sheppard and Elizabeth Hasselbeck :-)"
"Like I've been saying to the fellas: I've got ya'll back. Maybe OPRAH will get brave enough to invite me on her show one day."
"Haaa Haaaaaa. Just played an April Fool's Joke on my radio crew: Told'em I was the new character -- named Silvio Capone -- on....."
"<at>streethistory So do I. But it is what it is. ESPN knows I'm contractually free to appear. If they don't want to hire me back, that's their"
"<at>streethistory choice and their right. I respect it and wish them well. But I'm keeping it moving."
"<at>pcola_boy Whatever, it works."
"<at>TJ73Mustang Hey. That's the way it goes."
"<at>jrthebossman Good point. Orlando is a legitimate threat. That much is true."
"<at>vastandup I'll do my best, but I'll have to watch myself. THE VIEW is no joke. I'll need to come ready."
"<at>LaShuan Please do."
"<at>SpikeRocks I don't write bad columns, my man. I just write stuff you don't agree with or don't like. That's my job. Get over it."
"<at>Obanga What up, Bruh!"
"<at>Dakidsteph What up, my man?"
"<at>lizzys54 I'll never be on OPRAH. That's fine! I love her, anyway. But I think I can legitimately compete with Dr. Phil. I'm serious."
"<at>srcrenshaw They're struggling right now, but they'll be fine. I'll be there for the playoffs. No worries."
"<at>travdeem1 No problem, bro. My pleasure."
"<at>pcola_boy Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I knew I'd get a couple of folks :-)"
"<at>jrthebossman You've guessed correctly. He'll need to do that to keep Shaq in the game."
"<at>DRealtor Always, my dear."
"<at>MadameJourney Daaaaaammmmmmmnnnnnnn! Sorry babygirl. I can go on now, though, since you've educated me :-)"
"<at>PhillyGG Please do :-)"
"<at>wobblebody Will do!"
"<at>sonodoc99 Well, maybe if ya'll start a movement to get me my own show on CNN, all of that may change :-)"
"<at>LRDubbs Thank you. They're absolutely wonderful. Make me smile everyday."
"<at>nyrs_rangers Why Cranberry juice, bruh???"
"<at>jrthebossman Nope."
"<at>jrthebossman Maybe."
"<at>streethistory Thanks, my man. Appreciate the support."
"<at>KimKardashian Well, good luck with that :-) Sorry about you and Reggie.....I think."
"<at>nyrs_rangers Come on, now. Watch your mouth."
"<at>nyrs_rangers Yeah, I saw the movie. Actually, 50 cent suggested I drink a lot of Cranberry Juice. But it varies, depending on who gives it."
"<at>kepzilla Haaaaaaaa. Maybe not. But who knows."
"<at>iDavid25 FoxSports Radio."
"<at>chicago_ivy I don't plan too."
"<at>Sherilynnmo Thank you"
"<at>illakiladelph don't know. Haven't seen it yet."

"<at>mrogi Gotta measure the success of someone's production in college."
"<at>hollatmetoday Wish I could hear that one."
"<at>robin09mg0 To who?"
"<at>LexusLady4u Or......I might know a whole lot, but am more than willing to tell you what you may not want to hear? Ever think of that?"
"<at>TheUptownDiva Always will, my dear. Nice to hear from you. Hope you're well."
"<at>YPRuck (smile!!!)"
"<at>BellaNBK Well, tell me what you think you have? I'm listening."
"Remember folks: I'll be on THE VIEW on ABC tomorrow morning. Then I'll be on THE ED SHOW on MSNBC, then LARRY KING LIVE Monday night."
"<at>bballgyrl74 Thank you, my dear. Happy Easter."
"<at>BellaNBK Oooooh. I didn't know you were talking about that :-) Would never ask :-) I'm on my best behavior these days, dear"
"<at>scooterboard Always working, bro! No choice."

"<at>YPRuck There ya go."
"<at>BigLeagueWIFFLE Haaaaaaaaaa."
"<at>D_Shogun Nah. Gotta get back to Indy for the National Title game....or, to be more specific, Duke's Coronation"
"<at>kaze_neko Haaaaa. That sounds like the perfect woman....which doesn't exist :-)"
"<at>LexusLady4u You say ""negative."" I say ""real."" That's the problem: Just b/c u say something unpopular doesn't make it false."
"<at>NiKiGaio Thanks so much for the kind words. Much appreciated."
"<at>LaSportsanista Thank you so much, my dear. Very much appreciated."
"<at>BobbyBroad I know. I'll be ready. Plus, a few of my siblings (sisters) will be with me :-)"

"<at>mswilliamsworld Good Girl! :-)"
"<at>Deshair Trying to be all I can be, that's all."
"<at>LexusLady4u Never -- ever -- said all mean cheat. What I said was: It's work for ALL MEN NOT TOO. There's a difference."
"<at>CEOLeeYarbo Yes. In 7 over the Lakers."
"<at>netta1019AIFAN I'm good. Happy Easter."
"<at>BellaNBK Fatherhood. It's changed my life....SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE BETTER."
"<at>CerenityImage FoxSports Radio....East Coast Morning Drive (6-to-9 a.m.)"
"<at>CEOLeeYarbo Actually, yes. But I was wrong two years ago when I picked the Lakers to beat the Celtics."
"<at>LexusLady4u Simple: Just because it's hard for a man to be monogamous doesn't mean he doesn't deserve credit when he actually does it."
"<at>LexusLady4u Faithful is Faithful. No matter where your thoughts wander to."
"<at>CEOLeeYarbo I've been on the money about 95 percent of the time in my 16-year career. And the times I've been wrong on the playoffs can be"
"1 hand. I'm almost never wrong when it comes to the playoffs. But I've made a few emotional picks during the Finals. My bad."
"<at>LexusLady4u You're a beautiful, intelligent woman with common sense. You know what you know, even when it's difficult to swallow."
"<at>CEOLeeYarbo No apprentice needed. But I DO appreciate the offer."
"<at>pol_organizing Haaaaaaa. Yes Siiiirrrrrrrrr."
"<at>LexusLady4u Good Girl!"
"<at>blocdeniro Only if Richard Jefferson shows up."
"<at>majorisback Semis. They'll lose to Orlando or Cleveland in the second round."
"<at>kaze_neko I can respect your confidence. :-)"
"<at>netta1019AIFAN No. I'm out of the A.I. business. He believes I betrayed him when I was trying to help. Can't get involved with that anymore"
"<at>netta1019AIFAN But I love the brother....like a brotha. Sorry it's come to this."
"<at>goshift I'm trying."
"<at>rjpisciotti59 But of course :-)"
"<at>tebow904 LeBron. Too big. Too gifted. To complete a ballplayer. But Kobe's the best closer."
"<at>Supernola1 Cleveland over LA in seven."
"<at>Dabat0228 Yep. To beat Tennesee. But I picked them to lose to Butler, and Duke to beat W. Va....then Butler for the title."
"<at>Jay3asy You're entitled."
"<at>rjpisciotti59 Stop talking about my man, Skip. I love him."
"<at>majorisback cavs."
"<at>BuckeyesBest I don't know what the hell you're talking about. You're not getting $500 from me. I'm broke anyways :-)"
"<at>mthomas_86 Nope."
"<at>netta1019AIFAN Allen will probably never speak to me again. That's fine. I stand by what I had to do. I know what I did and why."
"<at>blocdeniro God Bless"
"<at>RichJava Nope."
"<at>majorisback Don't you read my tweets. I'm tired of repeating myself, bruh! Cavs over Lakers."
"<at>cw2147 First of all, I'm a journalist FIRST. Secondly, I didn't put his business out on the street. He did it by showing up at casinos/bars"
"<at>cw2147 Third, he quit on 3 teams in the last year. All of this transpired in the last year and it's a relevant b-ball story. It's the job."
"<at>ceeza130 Spare me."
"<at>BREEZEakaB_R_ Already answered that."
"<at>rjpisciotti59 Amen."
"<at>goshift Nope. If Shelvin Mack has cramps, you guys are done."
"<at>Supernola1 Possibly second round. Durant's the real deal. And so is Westbrook."
"<at>BuckeyesBest Sorry. You can't do that. The Knicks have been so god-awful defensively, you can't blame LeBron for changing his mind."
"<at>arthurfro You're entitled to your beliefs."
"<at>Jay3asy Duke by 15"
"<at>majorisback Yes."
"<at>Supernola1 I think it should."
"<at>BuckeyesBest It was a piece about NY for NY.COM. How can you not understand that?"
"<at>BIGG_MIC Thanks, bro. The Podcasts are on 570AM in LA. That's where they're all being posted for now."
"LeBron James update: Great comback by the Cavs today vs. the Celtics. But let me say this: LeBron has missed 7 ft's. Cavs can't win this way"
"<at>kamonsax Doubt it was that. Maybe he didn't want to go to the free throw line. Hmm!"
"<at>idolovegolf Absolutely."

"<at>Im_Jus_TK No doubt, my man. I always try to keep in touch with my peeps."
"<at>fleetwood78 I know i've said what I had to say."
"The Stephen A. Smith Show has begun. I've been talking Big Ben, ofcourse. Plus I'm getting into Commissioner Goodell -- calling for a 4-game"
"Suspension. That's right...I said it. You've got to send a statement to everyone. You've got to address perceptions, too."
"Especially since the Steelers traded Santonio Holmes. The world has to be reminded that BLACK PLAYERS aren't the only ones screwing up."
"<at>Mbridges_8 Because I specifically read the NFL's Code of Conduct Policy ON THE AIR. It says he violated the policy. Plain and simple."
"<at>BRETTTHAHITMAN It's coming, bruh! In fact, I'm finally having my camera installed, so it'll be some video podcast, too. :)"
"<at>Seanjohnfan He's right."
"<at>Twin66 I disagree. If you listen to my argument, all I said was White America is 66% of the populace. The Commish talks of league integrity"
"<at>Twin66 Image. Well, if that's the case, doesn't Ben affect the league's image more significantly than the others? It just makes sense, bro!"
"<at>BRETTTHAHITMAN I agree. But we must also recognize that since the country is majority WHITE, Big Ben being the star that he is, he has to"
"<at>BRETTTHAHITMAN dealt with. No way around it...if the Commish is serious about addressing the integrity of the league."
"<at>BigTuane Amen."
"<at>TheBigLead Good Moorrrrnnnnniiiinnnnnggggggg"

"<at>Travis_Bush Can't say he raped them, my man. I don't believe he did, and I'm glad he's not going to jail. But he has to be suspended."

"<at>TimmyD_WSJU Yes Sir."
"<at>J2Da_P Be glad all you want to, but don't take my words out of context. What I said was: If you're a white superstar, chances are your"
"<at>J2Da_P influence is more profound because you relate to more of the population. So when we're in the business of handing out disciplinary"
"<at>J2Da_P action against these black athletes -- under the guise that their influence/impact provides a negative fix on the league -- then it"
"<at>J2Da_P is significant, even moreso, when a White Superstar does something to impugn the league. That means you can't let them off, either."
"<at>J2Da_P If you've peeled racism from that, then you're the one with blinders on and it shouldn't matter than I'm not on ESPN anymore. B/c"

"<at>kqdareal We won't, so long as the power structure doesn't change."

"<at>nflgossipgirl We'll see."
"<at>tmaxwell1978 But of course."
"<at>Rollin_on_Dubz Racist? Homer? How am I either? What are you talking about?"
"<at>djwes21 Cool."
"People are beginning to get on my nerves with this RACE thing. NOBODY IS MAKING BIG BEN a Race issue. All I'm saying is that if The Commish'"
"Code of Conduct Policy is consistent with what he says it's suppose to be, you have to deal with Big Ben harshly b/c Goodell is talking of"
"the league's image. One of it's biggest stars -- who happens to be WHITE -- now finds himself in this situation. In a country 66% white. If"
"you were worried about the image before, wouldn't you be even more concerned about this now? It's ridiculous that people keep trying to turn"
"this into a race issue. It's not about Black/White. It's about Goodell claiming he's concerned about the impact on the league's image. Damn!"
"<at>thaceltsrule Thank ya."
"<at>PCreightonWCWP I never once said that was the case."
"<at>PCreightonWCWP I've already explained what I meant. If you don't comprehend and want to make it into something else, be my guess. Ur prob"
"<at>Mbridges_8 I think the Code of Conduct policy is incredibly unfair. But if Goodell is going to be consistent with it, he has to suspend Ben"

"BTW....all the Toronto Raptors want in return for Bosh in a sign-and-trade are draft picks and trade exception attached to it."
"Since any trade exception comes attached with 60% of whatever Bosh is due to make next season, that would give Toronto approx. $7-to-$8 to"

"Or grab the pod cast at StephenASmithShow.com, OR..AM570Radio.com, OR...FoxSportsRadio.com. Again, I agreed to Jesse Jackson. He's right on."
"<at>CoachDamonMoore Not the point, bruh! Is his statement correct or incorrect? That's the only question."
"<at>digitalman29 Most black folks felt otherwise upon reading that statement. That's just a fact."
"<at>BullsAllDay I agree. That's why I didn't do it. But once Jesse Jackson said what he said, the question was asked if it had validity. Yes!!!"
"<at>TashaDeidre Thank you, sweety."
"<at>pakudlak Why? Because he's wrong or because it's Jesse Jackson?"
"<at>MoeBandit What else is new."
"<at>JoshT_23 So predictable."
"<at>PurpleLAGold I think they'll win 2 in the next 4."
"<at>CoachDamonMoore i hear ya."
"<at>BobbyBroad It crossed the line and was extreme. But I did not bring up race. I just say that when asked if I had similar thoughts to"
"<at>BobbyBroad Jackson when I heard them, I agreed. It's what I heard all weekend, as well."
"<at>BobbyBroad Totally agree. But the ?? specifically regarded his response and how a lot of A-A folks felt upon hearing them. And I agreed."

"<at>sasquatch0z0 Spare me! Did no such thing. Just acknowledged that there are lots of folks who agree. It's true!"
"For the record, please let's not get things twisted. I do NOT think it was right for Jesse Jackson to bring up RACE. However, I DO BELIEVE"
"his sentiments are shared by a lot of folks in the African-American community. What Dan Gilbert said about LeBron was incredibly"
"uncomfortable to read. Lots of folks did not like it and took it exactly the way Rev. Jackson said -- even though ""Run-Away Slave"" was too"
"harsh, for sure. But clearly, Gilbert came across as feeling ""Entitled."" Like LeBron OWED him something. Lots of Black folks who leave 1 job"
"for another know precisely what Rev. Jackson was alluding to. Period! Folks can act like they don't know what he was talking about. They can"
"accuse him of invoking race all they want. But when you offend someone you don't get to dictate their reaction. You accept what you caused."
"<at>Deeflood Cool! I never said ALL OF US feel that way. But A LOT OF US do! We're entitled to FEEL what we FEEL. It's not about White People."
"<at>Deeflood It's about one specific person named Dan Gilbert. If folks want to make more of this, that's on them."
"<at>WorfWWorfington Actually, that's kind of true. But maybe it speaks to LeBron's disdain for Gilbert."
"<at>lacroix12 Stop being such a damn emotional wuss. We're talking about Gilbert -- not white folk. Just him. Don't personalize. Be bigger."
"<at>zachutley Limited!"
"<at>Johnnnybones I reported on By's show last week that the Knicks are trying to get him. He wants to come."
"<at>NoBail_4CT Nobody's saying he's a SLAVE. What is being said is that Gilbert made him sound like a piece of property. Jesse may have gone"

"<at>CNeilly Here's where you're wrong: What if that Latino shares Becks belief system?"
"<at>GCitizens He'll go to the Nets if the Knicks don't get their act together."
"<at>SoCalGal64 Yes Sir! Why can't I think Hannity is a ""Nice Guy"" AND disagree with his ideology from time to time? What's the problem?"
"<at>GCitizens Finding a 3rd team to make the team."
"<at>jonjon305 I knew that. That's not the point."
"<at>frican28 So do I. Love my boy, BT!!!"
"<at>Hendrew It's not sad at all. I have a voice to express myself to millions. What r u doing other than whining on Twitter? Perhaps, if you"
"<at>Hendrew were objective, you'd have a voice to. Instead, you just sound like a wuss."
"<at>Hendrew My best is Pelosi and Reid.....more than Obama. It's just good attention to throw the President in there."
"<at>GOSSIP_KILLS I meant it depends ON Glenn Beck."
"<at>JessicaLTerry absolutely. Depending on the audience and the pay"
"<at>AntiHipocrisy It's all insane."
"<at>AntiHipocrisy Juan Williams is usually right. A very, very knowledgable man."
"<at>dougyancey I picked Boston to win in 6. After every game in the Finals, he'd ask: ""You Still Confident in your pick?"" I did THE VIEW the"
"<at>dougyancey Day of Game 7. You know the rest. That's my man. He gave me a 25-minute interview a week later. He never let's me forget when"
"<at>dougyancey I'm wrong about ANYTHING concerning him. When he wins, that is. He says nothing about 2008 when Boston beat'em down."
"<at>JH0120 it damn sure won't be because of Sanchez"
"<at>Travis_Bush Damn. Sure seems that way. But we'll see."
"<at>AntiHipocrisy Damn good point."
"<at>AntiHipocrisy Rev. Al did have Ed Schultz of MSNBC in attendance, though."
"<at>AntiHipocrisy Not true. Toney's a masteful boxer. He'll need to get inside, first. That may happen quick, but not easily."
"<at>volman1970104 Hopefully."
"<at>JH0120 Yes they have. I've noticed the same thing."
"<at>AntiHipocrisy That's what I think, as well. But Toney's a fighter, not just a boxer. Dude knows how to survive, plus he's use to going 12."
"<at>AntiHipocrisy Still picking Couture, but I don't expect him getting Toney to the ground to be easy."
"<at>volman1970104 Yes. I think he's earned it."
"Fyi....as much as it hurts me to tell everyone this, make sure to watch Shaq's All-Star Comedy Jam on SHOWTIME right now. Taped during NBA"

"<at>fleetwood78 Nope. They don't need him. They need a big man."
"<at>TeiAundraMinter I luv ya back. And I deeply appreciate the support. I'll be back soon enough. Don't doubt it."
"<at>AntiHipocrisy Totally inexcusable. There's no excuse for ANY AMERICAN to ever do that."
"<at>TeiAundraMinter Yeah, but we got to get over that. Can't police what's in people's hearts and can't prove it either. Just keeps US down."
"<at>TeiAundraMinter As for Dr. King's Niece, there's nothing wrong with her wanting less Gov't and lower taxes. That's what I want. But......."
"<at>TeiAundraMinter she COULD have picked a better, more appropriate day to be with Beck instead of folks who actually marched with her uncle."
"<at>TeiAundraMinter I hear ya."
"<at>AntiHipocrisy I usually agree with you but you're wrong here. Rev. Al is entitled to those feelings, as is anyone persecuted. That's what"
"<at>AntiHipocrisy White America needs to deal with. You don't get to watch another group be persecuted, then condemn their unflattering remarks"
"<at>AntiHipocrisy against those they feel have persecuted them. And folks don't get to define what level of animosity one should harbor, either"
"<at>AntiHipocrisy You may get to police their actions, especially if they go too far. But that's about all. While I had no problem with Beck""s"
"<at>AntiHipocrisy rally, I certainly comprehend why someone like Rev Al would. Get jailed, beaten, demonized and have dogs sicced on you, then"
"<at>AntiHipocrisy you can go and have a problem with his position on Beck. I wouldn't dear be so insensitive. And I don't always agree with him"
"<at>TeiAundraMinter All good points. But if we're being real, there are some who are lazy and don't want to work, looking for Gov't handouts."
"<at>TeiAundraMinter Blacks wanted Gov't assistance to ensure that Civil Rights applied to ALL OF US. We never advocated Gov't control/intrusion"
"<at>TeiAundraMinter We don't benefit from handing over more control of our lives to the Gov't. And we hurt ourselves when we advocate"
"<at>TeiAundraMinter that because we look weak and incapable of fending for ourselves, which builds resentment from other ethnic groups. They"
"<at>TeiAundraMinter question our ability to stand on our own 2 feet.It strips us of the respect we desire, then -- at least at times -- when"
"<at>TeiAundraMinter we witness that disrespect, we assume it's RACISM. When, in fact, it just may be folks saying ""why don't ya'll get off your"
"<at>TeiAundraMinter ass like everybody else."" Remember, Farrakhan, Dr. King, Marcus Garvey, Honorable Elijah Muhammed, etc advocated Gov't"
"<at>TeiAundraMinter intervention. Never once did they advocate Gift dependency. Black America needs to remember that...then make their"
"<at>TeiAundraMinter political choices. Any decisions made w/o knowing facts -- made purely on emotion -- is utter stupidity. We disenfranchise"
"<at>TeiAundraMinter ourselves that way. That empowers everyone else over us. Now what sense does that make?"
"<at>TeiAundraMinter No problem. Good luck in all you do. Stay up."
"The Stephen A. Smith Show on Fox Sports Radio has begun. We're talking Clemens/McGwire/Bonds/O.J./, Clarett, college F-Ball & RELATIONSHIPS"

"<at>ewilltarheel1 No sir. That's the past. That ship has sailed. I'm moving forward."
"<at>dcboysfan22 Yep. But they didn't even make the effort with McGwire and Clemens. Those guys put themselves in that position."
"I'm about to read an email I received from a regular listener about how his Girlfriend tortured him. Wait until ya'll hear this. Yes, Ladies"

"<at>Prizzle01 No problem, Bro! Just trying to keep it real with my listeners :-)"
"<at>Prizzle01 no doubt. Tell'em I said ""what's up."""
"<at>rajivbais Because ya'll are talking about the law. I'm alluding to the process and the politics. McGwire and Clemens were given options"
"<at>rajivbais regarding their testimony. They were not FORCED to do anything under oath. Clemens CHOSE to do so and McGwire CHOSE to say: ""I'm"
"<at>rajivbais not here to talk about the past."" Regardless of what law enforcement body we're talking about, u r trying to tell me Bonds would"
"<at>rajivbais NOT have taken that option? Damn right he would have. But it was never given to him. Wake up and smell the old spice."

"<at>derekjhernandez with 2 hands. Ya'll need to stop the damn hypocrisy. Let's be real."
"<at>derekjhernandez Fair Enough. But when that's what you bring up, all you're doing is co-signing the B.S. Others throw out there. When are"
"<at>derekjhernandez folks going to embrace real talk? Instead of hating on different perspectives, appreciating the dialogue so we can all stop"
"<at>derekjhernandez hiding, instead? The No.1 thing that scares me is people thinking I'm not real and true to what I feel and say. I REFUSE to"
"<at>derekjhernandez be fake. To figuratively smile in my listeners face and tell them one thing, yet totaly feel another. Radio is suppose to"
"<at>derekjhernandez be about real talk. Real issues. Real people. Real flavor. My show -- ME -- is all about making sure we weed out the B.S."

"Let me say this: I'm hard pressed to believe Floyd Mayweather Jr. Put his hands on a woman, and I damn sure don't believe he committed Grand"
"Larceny. Obviously, all the facts need to come out and I'll reserve judgement, as all of us should. But he has too much to lose to put his"
"Hands on anyone, least of all a woman. As for Grand Larceny, come on! Sounds like he may have taken something BACK from a woman out of anger"
"Floyd's got a $60 mil deal on the table. And btw....is anyone going to acknowledge that these accusations always seem to arrive when guys"
"Are in position to get paid and can be hurt most by it? Just a thought."

"Some of these storylines are driving me nuts. They need to make more sense. I could write some better storylines than what I'm seeing."
"<at>Zakberry Don't get it twisted. I was watching Florida first, the GH, now Ohio State vs. Miami. Gotta be on my J.O.B. First and always."
"Here's the thing with GH: It's too damn obvious what Lisa is doing. A better storyline would've had her and Patrick having an affair, then.."
"Either her trying to kill Robin once Patrick didn't want to leave OR..Robin trying to kill her. Also, I would've like Sonny to string out"
"The D.A. By getting her into Bed...THEN having Brenda show up. Or better yet, have Sonny and Carly reconnect...then Brenda return. Also...."
"It would be nice for Alexis and Mac to hook up, too (both of them need to get some) and, as much as he annoys me, I miss Spanelli with Maxie"
"<at>kevinlockett Brooklyn's off the chain. But I'm hoping she'll hook up with Johnny."
"<at>Fariya_ Don't like him and LuLu together. She needs to be with someone who could get her to shut her mouth."

"That's another complaint about GH, BTW: You trying to tell me the writers can't come up with something for Johnnie better than his fixation"
"On Sonny? Please! He's got Olivia, who's gorgeous, and Brooklyn was seating him. This Sonny saga is pathetic. Really bothers me."
"Michael Vick has returned to college football. Reincarnated in the form of Michigan's Denard Robinson...who just ran for an 87-yard TD."
"<at>ItsSeeKayBee I am watching football. And I didn't ask you to follow me anyone. Stop bitching. Go follow someone else. I don't care."
"Liked that stiff-arm by Terrell Pryor. He seems a lot stronger than I thought he was. Great game with Miami/Ohio St."
"Terrible throw by Pryor on the goal line. Plus he was on the edge; could've easily scored. See??? Decision making is always key."
"It's Week 2 of the season and the season's already over for Va. Tech. Doesn't even make sense for them to play the rest of the season."
"I know JaCory Harris has made some mistakes, but this boy put at least 3 passes in his receivers hands and they've dropped them. Ridiculous."
"I Mean Damn! What more can the kid do. He's the only one who deosn't seem like a deer caught in the headlights."
"<at>Louiejodi2001 What are you talking about? I'm watching ALL the games."
"<at>GOSSIP_KILLS Open your eyes, pay attention and learn how to read. I've been tweeting about the games for 2 hours."
"<at>ELDRAGONE That was impressive by Christ."
"This kid Denard Robinson is a STAR. Plain and simple. What a spectacular performance. Under pressure. Drive in last 2 minutes. Special!!!"
"<at>Bryan__King We're talking football. Stop confusing the issues"
"Watching my girl Jemele Hill on SportsReporters this morning. I'm so proud of her. She's getting her groove back. Btw..no one's better than"

"<at>cousindannyjr The way I did it was report...because I'm a reporter. Everyone keeps remembering it was after th Atlanta Journal-Constitution"
"<at>cousindannyjr reported his wife had filed for divorce. What they keep forgetting is that report was in the aftermath of him quitting on"
"<at>cousindannyjr Detroit, Memphis and then Philadelphia. Connect the dots and you'll realize HE MADE IT NEWSWORTHY. Nobody pounced on the guy."
"<at>cousindannyjr Especially me....when you consider all I COULD HAVE WRITTEN. But it is what it is. Damn shame, because I love the brother."
"Let me say this right now: When the Patriots win this game, don't point the finger at T.O. Or Ochocinco. N.E.'S defense -- it's speed -- is"
"Big time. Carson Palmer is getting no protection, no time to throw. Cincinnati's O-Line looks helpless. That's the issue right now."

"I said this weeks ago: This season is on Carson Palmer (offense) and Marvin Lewis (defense). Bad INT by Palmer; no pressure. No excuse."
"What a kick by Nugent for the Bengals. 54 yards. Right down the middle. Plenty of room. The Bengals offensive MVP so far, although Benson"
"Has looked solid."
"Damn! Damn! Damn! Cincinnati gets the ball back in time for one last Hail Mary before halftime, yet T.O. And Ochocinco were both in the"
"Locker room by then. How much you wanna make a bet we won't hear the end of this? Damnit!"
"Jake Delhomme throws an interception for the Browns. Why the hell am I NOT surprised. Speaking of the Brown: Delhomme get $7 mil on top of"
"The $12 mil he's getting from the Panthers this year....but Mike Holmgren's answer to curbing cost for the Browns is asking THE GREAT JIM"
"BROWN to take a paycut before letting him go???? A damn pox on the Cleveland Browns for this move. Disgraceful."

"Since Cincinnati refused to play any defense, I switched over to the Giants/Panthers. This kid Charles Godfrey in Carolina's secondary looks"
"Completely lost. He looked like he didn't even know Ahmad Bradshaw had the ball on his near-TD run. Tackling was awful, too."
"<at>nycmadman Damn. Did he even play today? Never heard his name."
"<at>JUSNYTWEET No Sir!!!"
"<at>Tek13 Doesn't matter. Too little, too late."
"The person I feel sorry for most is Steve Smith of the Carolina Panthers. An absolute stud receiver playing for another pathetic looking QB"
"That call against Calvin Johnson of the Detroit Lions is one of the worse calls I've seen in NFL History. It should be overturned and the"
"Lions should be awarded the game. I'm serious, it's a flat-out ridiculous call. I can't believe I'm saying this but the Lions were robbed!!!"
"And another thing: The Bears suck. They're running game stinks. First, Thomas Jones is gone, then Cedric Benson. That's what they get!!!"
"Also....the Bears' offensive line stinks too. Cutler played well, but was almost killed because they're so awful."

"Eddie Long. But, to me, based purely on his willingness to hide behind his lawyers up to this point, having refused to address these"

"Definitely be watching tomorrow morning when CNN airs the sermon to his congregation LIVE. It had better be a damn good one."
"<at>mrsmartbusiness I doubt it!"
"<at>jigwilliams They say 8 am and 11 am."
"<at>otis31 That he's innocent. And state it convincingly. Aside from that, I can't imagine."
"<at>last1ofseven Then he needs to be as convincing in his innocence as he's been in building his congregation thru speaking all these years."
"<at>Sesan72 Let's hear what the man has to say first."
"<at>jmj31 Agreed."
"<at>jmj31 Brothers are thinking markets now as much as anything. But I don't think Melo would be offended by being in Orl w/ D-Howard."

"<at>HappyHappy1820 OoooooooooK."
"<at>grant_mayfield True dat!"

"<at>michaeltillery Where?"
"<at>TimPeterson17 yeah man. I know. I'm worried"
"<at>FLOWERSJOAN Joan, you need to get over that and take a chance. Don't focus on what ur giving; focus on what ur getting. U won't feel used."

"As promised,....I am wide awake, Ladies and Gentlemen. Waiting to see what Bishop Eddie Long has to say about these accusations."
"<at>blackicefitz Stay Tuned. Stay Tuned! :-)"
"I can't believe CNN. They're LIVE for Bishop Long...right up until the moment he's ready to speak. Then they go away to State of the Union."
"DAMN RIDICULOUS!!!"
"Ok! Just finished watching Bishop Long on-line. First: I HOPE HE'S INNOCENT. Sincerely. The man has done a lot of good. With that said:"
"While sensitive to the fact that his lawyers have advised him NOT to try this case in the media, his claims that he is ""not this man being"
"Portrayed in the media,"" that he feels like ""David vs. Goliath,"" and that this is something ""he will fight"" doesn't address is INNOCENCE!!!"
"At no time did Bishop Long utter the word ""innocent."" At no time did he say he was being ""lied"" on. I will leave it at that for now."
"So let me get this straight: Bishop Long just holds a press conference to say HE'S NOT holding a press conference? To not answer questions?"
"Then, according to MSNBC, 31 people have approached the DA with similar accusations??? Let's just say this: Damn, this looks really bad!!!"
"And it's not just because of the accusations. It's because Bishop Long is making things look WORSE. He could've said all he said the moment"
"These accusations came out. If he's not guilty, he's doing a piss-poor job of coming across that way. Period."
"Fyi everyone......I taped ""Your Money"" with Ali Velshi on CNN this Friday. It aired yesterday re-airs today at 3 pm. Check me out."
"<at>Carden122 Sorry, but I was born in the Bronx. Raised in Hollis, Queens NY. And there's nothing about my life that was middle class."
"I've said enough about Bishop Long for the time being. I'm in football now. Need to see what M.Vick does. And whether the Cowboys will step"
"up today. If they don't, I'm predicting Wade Phillips will be fired tomorrow (no inside info....just a guess). Then we'll get to find out"
"out if Jason Garrett -- the off. coordinator being paid as much as Phillips -- is really worth it. Plus, don't forget the Jets/Dolphins."
"This message is directed at CBowman21: I don't talk down to ANYONE. I simply address what they do. I don't personalize. I say what the facts"
"Tell me. I'm no shining example of anything, aside from being a guy who works hard and tries to be honest. I'm far from perfect to. But...."
"Unlike some folks in the public eye, I don't spend a spec of time trying to curry favor for myself by manipulating people's thoughts of me."
"I simply say who I am and exhibit ZERO PROBLEMS is telling folks to mind their damn business and go kick rocks. Learn the difference, sir!"

"<at>AskTheOz I respect Tavis. Always have, even when I disagree with him. That's for others to criticize."
"To Hell with any potential Wade Phillips firing. The man in trouble may be Giants' coach, Tom Coughlin. They don't want to play 4 him."
"<at>Jamoriel1 I was thinking about that, but it's not SF' style to make such a decision this early."
"This is a great Atlanta vs. New Orleans game, btw."
"As of right now, Michael Vick's my player of the day. Kansas City shocked the hell out of me. The Giants disappointed me. And..."
"it's time to lay off the Cowboys. This was a big win for them. Can't believe Roy Williams was the star of the day. Just goes to show..."

"I just say that Dez Bryant paying $54,896 for a meal with his teammates was stupid -- mainly b/c it was publicized. With the NFL in CBA"
"Talks with NFLPA, this is the worse possible time to do something like that. There's an economic recession. The public is always manipulated"
"During these times, similar to the NBA pouncing on Kenny Anderson's ire over having to surrender 1 of his 8 cars back in 1998. The fact that"
"Dez Bryant is black just makes those situations worse."
"Yes! I said it."
"I am NOT saying Dez Bryant is a Black-White issue. What I'm saying is: if a league is negotiating a CBA, you can't have a black player out"
"There FLOSSING in anyway. It doesn't look good. Doesn't work for the players. Period."
"<at>BUSSEATHLETICS Guess so. It's worked for 17 years and you're following me. So who's the WHORE?"
"And for the record, it's not a matter of ME being unable to get past issues remotely pertaining to race. It's me POINTING OUT THE MASSES'"
"Inability to get past it. It's me pointing out what will come back to bite Dez Bryant and the Cowboys. It ain't always fun telling the true."
"But damnit, sometimes it's necessary."
"I've got nothing else to say on this matter. Just wait and see if a CBA agreement is not reached, then listen to the rhetoric."

"<at>fdjonesjr I never once said color had anything to do with what happened. What I said was: Brothers have to watch situations they get"

"<at>Erockalypse can't it simply be about businessmen who know how to stigmatize and market the opposition in a way that will benefit themselves"

"My man Jay Glazer is reporting that Moss is officially a Viking..for a 3rd round pick. One Minute after my show finished. DAMN! DAMN! DAMN!"
"Peeps can say whatever they want about Moss. I'm simply saying a couple of things: Although he was wrong to focus on griping after wins on 2"
"Occasions this season, let's understand why. He wanted to stay in New England, but knew they didn't want to pay him and he would have to"
"Leave. And...for the first time he wasn't getting the ball. This.....while he's in a contract year. Moss could've handled things differently"

"Birthday. He's having a party and asked that I attend. So here I am. Just because I don't always agree doesn't mean I can't pay my respects."
"Happy Birthday Rev. Jackson"
"<at>whitehurstchris He and I talked about that more than a year ago. And I told Rev. Jackson that to his face."
"<at>jrnyofthefool You have a right to feel that way. I did too. But the man's acknowledged his flaws, he's trying to change and he's 69."
"<at>jrnyofthefool it's called COMPASSION. At least that's how I fell."

"The Stephen A. Smith Show is on LIVE right now. About to go all-in about Moss/Belichick and FAVRE -- especially FAVRE, in light of what"
"Dead spin is reporting. Tune in."
"Call up the show at 877.99.ONFOX. Text me a Facebook.com/StephenAFans."
"Just finished commenting about Favre and I'm about to do it again. Let me say this: We can get on Favre about his play, his avoiding"
"Training camp, and this nauseating love affair some in the media have with him. But to report on him trying to get with some girl is just"
"Wrong. More importantly, it's none of our damn business. What's more, it epitomizes why athletes hate the media. You don't dime out the dude"
"Like this. Especially if you're a dude -- b/c we all know we've chased honies from time-to-time in our lives. It's hypocritical. And for"
"Those who'd compare this to Tiger, STOP IT RIGHT NOW! Tiger was an issue because a police report was filed following his car accident and"
"The belief surrounding why it occurred. That's not the case with Favre. It's messed up. And although I respect Deadspin, they're wrong here."
"You just don't do this. It ain't right."
"However, in the world of TMZ, Radar online and others, I really can't knock DEADSPIN. It's all business. I guess I'm just saying it's wrong"
"<at>ninnles I have no idea what you're talking about. And don't bring God into this equation."
"Check out my latest podcast about Roy Halladay and the Phillies' expected march to the World Series - www.PhillySportsDaily.com"
"I see people are blogging about my comments on Favre and Deadspin already. Here's all I have to say: It's incredibly understandable for any"
"Woman to be perfectly okay with what Deadspin reported. For obvious reasons. But for any man to BREAK this kind of story -- knowing the"
"Things we've done as MEN -- is totally hypocritical. AND WE ALL KNOW IT! Nobody's condoning anything. But If the FELLAS can't understand"
"What I'm saying, all you're doing is playing to public opinion. You're not being real, and I have nothing else to say."
"1 more thing: I'm not putting ALL MEN in any category. I'm saying men know what a lot of men do and on most occasions we mind our business."
"So what's different now. And for those who want to point out what I wrote about A.I., read the damn articles before opening your mouth."
"I REPORTED on A.I. There's a litany of things dating back YEARS. I literally quoted sources, didn't get specific -- and there were witnesses"
"To corroborate anything I said. Plus I covered the man for a decade. I'm not someone who talks about people I never talk to. I'm standing"
"Here. ALWAYS! Just like I'm doing right now. Nobody's hiding. I respect what DEADSPIN felt it had to do. Respect that I believe it's wrong."
"More importantly, respect the reasons why or turn in your damn man card. It's that simple. You don't have to be a trifling man to understand"

"Pascal keeps hitting B-Hop in the back of the head. Still, though, you can wake up one day and find out ur 45 yrs old. That's what may be"
"Happening to Hopkins."
"Hopkins has won the last 3 rounds. But Pascal is still very dangerous. He's fast and powerful. But Hopkins is fighting smarts. Body shots"

"<at>getupshow Agreed."
"This is unbelievable. It's Round-10 and B-Hop is WINNING this fight. Body Shots. The Jab. Straight rights. Wow!"
"I've got B-Hop winning at least the last 6 Rounds. No way he should lose this fight if it goes to decision. Too many body shots by Hopkins."
"DAMN RIDICULOUS. The decision was a MAJORITY DRAW. Hopkins got robbed. He won the last 8 Rounds and they called it a draw. BULLSHIT!!!"
"<at>AntiHipocrisy You were saying, Sir???"

"Hey everyone. Appreciate all the prayers for my Mom. Thanks so much, but she'll be just fine. She just was feeling to well over the Holidays"
"Didn't mean for folks to get the wrong impression. I was responding directly to a personal friend who'd tweeted me -- I thought -- privately"

"<at>Reid_Rothschild So, just to be clear, ur saying we can't get along and befriend people we disagree with? Are you that damn ignorant?"
"<at>Reid_Rothschild What the hell are you? And English teacher?"

"<at>jahwilliams8 into a billion-dollar business, only to turn around and deny them opportunities earned. That's just real."
"Lots of folks keep asking ME about a TV Show. Ask the Networks. Tweet them and see what happens. Talent can only display what THEY allow."

"<at>Livewire1914 :-) Not a bad idea."
"<at>golden1ne Maybe. He's got the Dunks down pat. But dribbling and what you use to get to the basket matters style-wise."
"<at>TrainaMan Yes! You Should :-)"
"<at>ramelmerciful Wouldn't mind that at all :-)"
"<at>ramelmerciful 49ers need Harbaugh. But not nearly as much as they need a new QB. They better go after Vince Young. And Minny needs McNabb."
"<at>TrainaMan Happy New Year. In your part of town next week. Email me at Holler<at>StephenA.com."
"<at>JeanNYKNicks Same as always. Knicks don't want to surrender Chandler AND Gallanari."

"<at>mfansela 49ers. Weaker Division. Better chance for immediate success."
"<at>SheltonMercer Not fair to VY. I respect Fisher, but 16 yrs, 1 SB Appearance and no titles shouldn't equate to him staying and VY leaving."
"<at>adotdavis Because of what I just told you. Favre making passes at honies is entirely different than Tiger getting clubbed for screwing 20"
"<at>adotdavis different women. What part of that is difficult for you to comprehend?"
"<at>ArsenioOFFICIAL Yes you are. He's the best. And so are you, my brother: the man Hip-Hop owes so much to. Happy New Year, my man."
"<at>TachDogg Never once saw it."
"<at>LetEmBurnIT The same damn thing I said before: The Seahawks should not have been in the playoffs and they DAMN SURE should not have hosted"
"<at>LetEmBurnIT a playoff game. It's a crying shame the Saints were sent across the country to play this game, and I'm not even a Saints' fan."
"<at>LetEmBurnIT They got royally screwed by the NFL. Changes definitely need to be made. And there's no way a team under .500 should be in the"

"<at>LetEmBurnIT will not change my thoughts at all. No way in hell. Enjoy your weekend."
"What a drive. I like what I'm seeing from the Jets right now. So long as Sanchez doesn't screw up, it's up to their ""D""."
"What an idiotic play by Ty Smith. I'm sorry, that's just stupid to rough the kicker at that point. I want the Jets to win but Damn!"
"Alright. Jets already in FG Range. Now Folks just has to come thru. He's no Vinateri, but he doesn't need to be."
"Keep our eyes on Sanchez, though!"
"Yyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>Joey2Cool12 Not the point. You know damn well what I'm saying. The Seahawks should not have been allowed in the playoffs. Period."
"<at>Joey2Cool12 Anyone can win on any given week in the playoffs. So what they won. To be in the playoffs is bad enough. But to be allowed to"
"<at>Joey2Cool12 Host a playoff game despite being 5-games worse smacks in the face of a regular-season meaning anything. It's wrong."
"<at>Joey2Cool12 Enjoy your week of joy. Seattle deserves it b/c it's a great city. But the NFL should be ashamed of itself."
"<at>milicigoran Nothing for me to deal with. I'm just responding to ???. Ya'll don't like it then don't ask. Simple!!!"

"The thing is, I'd gladly do sports for the next 25 years if I could guarantee I'd be allowed to do so. But considering the changes in the"
"World of sports, Network TV Deals, influence of the Commissioners -- and my noted candor -- one has to consider longevity. Staying power."

"<at>kammo19 I've been a bonafide journalist for 18 years, elevating myself from a High School Beat Writer to one of only 30 Black COLUMNISTS in"
"<at>kammo19 this country's history. Notice how folks try to minimize one's status, one's accomplishments? I wonder why that is!!!"

"<at>JHova1982 You're assuming I'm unemployed silly man! So ignorant!"

"<at>MsWilliamsWorld huh? What r u talking about?"
"<at>MrShyneAllDay Yes!"
"<at>MsWilliamsWorld No Comment :-)"
"I'm about to be on Fox Sports Radio with Tony Bruno is just a few minutes. Talking NBA, I assume. Along with anything else he'd like to ask."
"Someone just asked me if ""individualism"" was ruining the NBA Game. I think the game is great. It struggled for a while, but it's climbing."
"The quality of the game is not the problem. The problem is the ongoing collective bargaining negotiations. Make no mistake, there will be a"
"lockout unless the players cave. They simply have NO LEVERAGE whatsoever and the owners will actually make money if a lockout comes."

"<at>Caldwell676 No games means no bills, no salaries to pay. Meanwhile, owners will still get $$$ from the networks. BINGO!!!"
"<at>mnryan73 We do. Remember, you've got to draw folks out sometimes. Sometimes the little bit you know - the report - is what draws folks out"
"<at>Chewi863 Never. They can talk all the way but if they didn't void it years ago with Jordan, they won't do it now. Only the stars will get"
"<at>Chewi863 paid with decertification. Nobody else. How many legitimate stars do you think there are in the league?"
"<at>the_realkylem No doubt. I'll holler at you later."
"Just wanted to point out 2 things before going to bed: Kevin Durant is a top-two league MVP Candidate. And Russell Westbrook is an All-Star."
"Yes. I'm saying Westbrook is an all-star....AHEAD of Chris Paul. Never thought I'd say that, but it's true. Okla. City is legit. Seriously."
"This is sports, so I love all this trash talking going on. But it's different for me with the Jets. They've won NOTHING. And they're"
"with the Patriots. That's just not smart. The one thing I hate is a BLOWOUT. Especially in the playoffs. I hope I don't see that on Sunday."
"<at>brandamc Thanks, my man. Appreciate that love."
"<at>TheReal_MoBetta I love it. I'm just worried because the Pats are no joke."

"<at>giltyree What time?"
"<at>mitstick26 I stand by what I've said. Every squirrel's entitled to bust a nut every now and then."
"<at>JLewit A miracle."
"<at>mitstick26 They've been doing it for three years."
"<at>Kandigirl1066 Yes Ma'am."
"<at>LetEmBurnIT I expected Green Bay to win. What I didn't expect was this kind of blowout. All it showed me was that the Falcons were frauds."
"<at>Kandigirl1066 Nope. But I will be very soon. God Willing :-)"
"<at>LetEmBurnIT You still sure about that? :-)"
"<at>FosterWilkins Yeah! I would've been nice to be on the ESPN Panel about Race. But you can't have everything. My time will come again."
"<at>MeloLalaChicago I wouldn't put things that harsh, bruh! I DID say if one of them had chosen differently, then anything could've happened."
"<at>MeloLalaChicago But that they'd always planned on playing together. D-Wade is one of the best people in pro sports. Ya gotta remember that."
"<at>ArsenioOFFICIAL I know, bruh! I know. I guess they're trying to be different. But what Oregon should really try and do is emulate f-ball."
"<at>AmeriieWarriors Appreciate the love, Amerie. Thank you so much. But just so you know, i've been gone from ESPN for nearly 2 yrs. Take care."
"<at>rodneyperry Thanks, bro!"
"Un-Freakin-believable. I never thought in my wildest dreams the Jets would win this game. Major props to their defense AND Rex Ryan!!!"
"<at>BrettBehrens Language please! Language."
"However, I don't want to hear a damn thing about the Sehawks. Thank God their sorry butts got beat down today. They never deserved 2 b there"
"<at>chaim7785 they could, but I've got to see it to believe it."
"3 Convenient things dominating my thoughts: Packer vs. Bears WITHOUT FAVRE. Sanchez Shines on same day Seahawks lose -- and Pete Carroll"
"Gets bounced. Remember, he said Sanchez wasn't ready."
"Can we stop being idiots' please. Carroll's comments is not about the fact that he said it 2 yrs ago. It's that he said it AT ALL. And the"
"Irony of it being that he's bounced from a playoff he didn't deserve to be on on THE SAME DAY that Sanchez advanced to the AFC Title Game."
"No wonder known folks hesitate to tweet some of you. Why the hell should I have to waste tweets explaining this, with the few of you acting"
"Like you're so idiotic that you don't understand where I'm coming from or what I'm trying to say. Wake up and exercise common sense. Please!"
"<at>CNeilly I'm not talking to anyone like their BELOW. I come from the gutter. I know better. Who I'm talking to like that are people who act"
"<at>CNeilly SLOW....seemingly on purpose, continuously misconstruing what I'm saying for the sake or arguing. My comment about Sanchez was"
"<at>CNeilly simply about pointing out the irony of Pete Carroll's elimination occurring on the same day Sanchez advanced -- after talking smack"
"<at>CNeilly about Sanchez is such a classless fashion 2 yrs ago. In other words, payback's a *#<at>$<at>. What the hell is so hard about that to"
"<at>CNeilly understand? Unless, ofcourse, you want to be clueless for the sake or arguing. If that's classifying yourself as ""little people,"""
"<at>CNeilly then consider yourself MINI-ME! Happy New Year."
"Happy MLK DAY. Remember: content of one's character is what it's all about. Without ""Character"" what do you have? What are you really worth?"

"<at>bigbraz Yep!"
"<at>JLewit What the HELL is this world coming to :-)"
"<at>matthouston59 With some, you have a point. But not with the majority. Again, addressing the iniquities of actions from the PAST is not"
"<at>matthouston59 condemning a race. It's pointing out what actually happened. Folks who personalize and get defensive over it only indict"
"<at>matthouston59 themselves."
"<at>JeanNYKNicks They're trying. Something should go down this week. NJ's still out in front, though."
"<at>cthagod I couldn't agree more with that statement. Amen."
"No matter what I see from Orlando, nor how great the trade, there's nothing that tells me they can beat the Celtics. Absolutely nothing!"
"<at>toddotronic D-Howard's just fine. Needs to hit more FT's that's all. They've got talent and shooters now, but they need a beast at 4-spot"

"<at>vdiazheat Nope!"
"<at>ThisisSmitty :-)"
"<at>jrnyofthefool I don't take injuries into consideration. Of course teams will lose if marquee guys go down. I only predict assuming"
"<at>jrnyofthefool everyone's healthy. If anyone gets injured, all bets are off."
"<at>matthouston59 Come on, man. Now you really seem off your rocker. Did it ever occur to you that guys go out of their way to market"
"<at>matthouston59 themselves b/c if they don't, they'll never have anything? The NFL markets Brady, Manning, Brees and -- in the past - McNabb."
"<at>matthouston59 Everyone else was basically told to go kick rocks. Folks market and advertise who they want. It's always about their brand."
"<at>matthouston59 so if players find another way to do it for themselves, God Bless them. Your problem is you want them to be at the mercy of a"
"<at>matthouston59 a system that has continuously shown they don't give a damn about them. They're not having that and I don't blame them."
"<at>matthouston59 Has nothing to do with payback/reparations. Has everything to do with opportunities available TODAY. The only person holding"
"<at>matthouston59 onto the past is You. Then you have the nerve to bring up race as if it's somebody else's problem -- Not YOURS. That's as"

"string QB was on the field doing a better job than you. The players will never respect him again. Neither will the city of Chicago. Awful!"
"It's reasons like this why teams like the Jets speak so glowingly of Big Ben while, despite all his talents, no one has a positive word to"
"Cutler. No excuse for this nonsense. I'm so happy for Rodgers and GB, just to erase the memory of Brett Favre. But Cutler? A joke. PATHETIC!"

"<at>klubs110 No sir! Not when I saw him riding that bicycle. I remember in college when Byron Leftwich was CARRIED downfield by off. lineman."

"<at>nflplayoff complain about your leg when IT'S YOUR ARM that's needed. It's inexcusable. Spare me the excuses."
"Don't know if anyone noticed, but I'm looking pretty damn good right now by picking the Packers and Steelers."
"Just saw Urlacher coming to the defense of Cutler. DAMN RIGHT HE SHOULD! That's his teammate. But I'm not. And neither are Chicago Fans."
"As long as Cutler could throw the football, he should've had his you know what out on that field. End of discussion."
"Simple question: How does Rex Ryan NOT give the ball to Green -- instead of LT -- after 2 big runs he had in that drive. The Jets will be"
"haunted by this they lose."
"IF THEY LOSE. Excuse me!"
"<at>ShogunEwing Depends on how you look at it. If you can come back in the regular season, you can come back for a shot at the Super Bowl."
"<at>Solo_ist I'm sorry. Did you play???"
"<at>rwendt40 You're very welcome."
"Braylon Edwards is balling in this second half. I give credit where credit is due. Sanchez is, too, by the way. Where is the Steelers D?"
"And give Rex Ryan some credit, too. Gutsy, if nothing else."
"Great drive by the Jets. I have no idea where the Steelers Defense has been this second half. They're getting picked apart. It's not over."
"Here's my issue: Since Big Ben has lost his center, and this backup is clearly struggling, why are you on the sidelines with ur hands in ur"

"<at>weezl3 I'm one of the happiest people on the family. Wonderful family. Loyal, fierce, loving friends. Sorry. Wrong guy!"
"<at>Solo_ist That's the pt. If you can go thru all of that in the regular season, why can't you endure with a SB berth on the line?"
"<at>jpminard Not even a little bit. I'm not ??? Cutler's injury. I'm saying if you can walk and ride a bike, you can drop back and throw a ball"
"<at>CosmoFurthur Not even a little bit. Read my tweets and stop asking me the same questions. I said what I said."
"For the record, to all those harassing me about my remarks re: Cutler, please know: I'M NOT BACKING UP FROM WHAT I SAID ONE DAMN BIT."

"<at>sogron007 Do your homework before talking about me, SOGRON007!"

"For the record, I did not rush to judgement because my judgement is not based on the legitimacy of Cutler's injury. It's based on one simple"

"<at>Print3Oakville Thank you for the kind words :-)"
"On a side note, I wanted to say I think it's incredibly unfortunate that Keith Olbermann is gone from MSNBC. I don't know the man. Only met"
"Him once. Certainly didn't always agree with him and even remember him labeling me as his WORSE PERSON IN THE WORLD one time. But there is"
"No doubt he did a helluva job for that network -- and for liberals across this nation. Just b/c I'm an independent doesn't mean I didn't"
"Notice. His show was top-rated for the network and it gave MSNBC a presence. Knowing all of that, it's unfortunate that he's gone. Evidently"
"Because he was DISLIKED! Not because he was unproductive. And that.....is the saddest part of it all. Just my 2 Cents."

"A couple of points I wanted to make: It was nice seeing LeBron do his thing, but it's just a reminder that Orlando just doesn't have enough."
"The other point I wanted to make is that it's now the end of the 3rd QT and the Lakers are down 66-63. It's just the regular season, but we"
"need to see something from the Lakers in this 4th QT. They're still the best in the West, but they would've ran over SA after all the"

"<at>GuruJD86 Yep. Pretty much."

"<at>EDDiEFLEiSCHER Amen brother."
"<at>AntiHipocrisy I hear ya."
"<at>AntiHipocrisy I pray you're right."
"<at>pdubbt Can't see that. All the dude did was take out his offensive linemen. Plus, he didn't miss curfew. That's not fair to him."
"<at>antnez no he's not. But I agree with you that more folks need to step up."
"<at>smagula So am I. About as much as anyone would care about anything you have to say."
"<at>DuaneRankin Yeah! Thing is, I don't want the Steelers to win that way. I want the best on the field at all times...win, lose or draw."

"<at>Devan_J Haaaaaaaaaa."
"<at>NowMuzic I'm trying to, but I'm a Steelers fan and I'm not feeling good about this."
"Sorry folks: Is it just me or is this halftime show just not that impressive? I'm not trying to hate on anybody, but come on!!!"
"<at>dogmanx23 Stop it. Orlando's not beating Miami if they meet in the playoffs."
"And one more thing: They should all lip-sync during the halftime show. They'll sound a helluva lot better."
"Ooops. Pause all of that for a second. I had no idea USHER would be performing at halftime. That changes everything. He's a bad, bad boy."

"<at>DaRi013 no sir.need to though"

"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Mr. Big-Shot. No.3....Chaun-ceeeeeeeeeeeeee Bi...Bi...Bi...Billups!!!!
Not D the hell up, New York Knicks."
"Exceptional fourth quarter by Chauncey, but really bad decision of not knowing your personnel. You don't throw the ball to Walker right then"
"Big-time block by Amar'e. Nice teamwork with him and Melo. Williams hits 4 clutch FT's down the stretch. NY showing they actually can play D"
"Yeeeeeaaaaaahhhh. Knicks got it done. Second time this week LeBron misses a three at end of regulation. Ya think D-Wade should get the Rock."
"BTW.....say what you want but Melo played some damn defense today. Melo ASKED to defend LeBron for the game's last 7 min. That's what's up!"

"<at>jcorps12 My man, that's totally cruel and unnecessary. It's really not that serious. Take a chill pill and grow up."
"<at>gershtownPDX That should play no role as to how I report. That's the problem: folks r too concerned about who they like; not what's real."
"<at>VPholic LeBron is NOT overrated. He's a beast. Just not comfortable shooting in last 2 minutes."
"<at>DocGonzo8404 I do. I get much love. But that's not enough. Folks have to support shows with minorities if they want to see more of us."

"Don't worry about this Heat loss....or the one coming against the Lakers on Thursday. Wade has grown impatient. GREAT sign. They'll be fine."
"<at>deeburna Ofcourse the Miami bench is a problem. But LeBron and Wade knew that during that whole celebration. That's why you don't do that."

"<at>DeuceSkywalker How about this one. Imagine if Miami had the No. 1 pick and drafted D-Rose. Remember, LeBron would've still came as a FA."

"Is the fact that he ADMITTED he was with grown-ass men walking around in a mall with their pants hanging down below their butts. Enough of"
"Condoning this nonsense. There's no reason for it. It's stupid. I even had one of my boys -- a police officer -- tell me: ""Shhh. Don't tell"

"Can be a reflection of you. Especially the kind of doesn't know -- or care -- how to carry themselves in public. We've got to stop condoning"

"And btw....if Dez Bryant didn't think it was an issue, he would not have separated himself from his friends by saying it was THEM with their"
"Pants down and not him. If he knew it was THEM, then he shouldn't know better to going to the mall with THEM looking that way. Bogus excuse."

"<at>blackrobblive it's only 2 hours"
"The Stephen A. Smith Show on 710 ESPN LA comes on 9-11 pm Tonight. We will NOT discuss Kobe Bryant. We will, however, discuss the homosexual"
"Communities sensitivity to the ""F"" work, the attacks against Kobe and these comparisons that continue to be drawn with the Gay vs. Black"
"Plight. I have had enough with these damn comparisons. I'm tired of folks dancing around it and I'm putting an end to it all TONIGHT."
"Listener and viewer discretion is STRONGLY advised."
"<at>tornado2449 Definitely Jason Kidd."

"<at>PCtypesCanSukit Wrong attitude to have."
"<at>TheJoshResnick Yes! Knicks will win Game 3...their home opener on Friday night."
"<at>tikki3 Good point."
"<at>rb3b3 Yes Maam! I mean, sir :-)"
"<at>rb3b3 Never!"
"<at>rb3b3 I don't gamble. Especially with strangers. And never on the game of basketball. That's the equivalent of Insider trading."
"<at>oomgo Whatever you say, sir! I don't understand."
"<at>daldridgetnt Damn! Damn! Damn!"
"Love Carlos Boozer by TYLER HANSBROUGH is giving it to him right now. If Pacers win this game, he'll be the reason why!!!"
"Yes Sir! But I've always been a fan of Tyler Hansbrough, so you're rhetoric is unnecessary in this case, my man :-)"
"Disastrous 4th QT for the Heat. Doesn't speak well about LeBron and Bosh."
"Give the Sixers credit though. Collins can really, really coach"
"<at>mooreGMEN10 Who the hell called this LeBron's team???"
"With all that being said about LeBron, folks really need to get off his back about being in Miami. I'm tired of folks acting the wouldn't"
"Want his 29 ppg in playoff competition just because he doesn't close. Stop being so damn phony."
"<at>Aj_TomTom Totally untrue and inaccurate concerning me. Evidently. Liars like you have no problem with that, though."
"A special edition of the Stephen A. Smith Show on 1050 ESPN NY is coming at you today 10 am to 12 Noon EST. Knicks playoff preview. Do I"
"Need to say anymore? Go to ESPNNY.com to listen live or get the ESPN Radio App. It's worth it."
"<at>Corporate718 I sincerely hope so!"
"<at>Lumbardh I'm not now. But I'm a Knicks' fan, so I'm going to highlight what gives them the best chance. I still won't change my prediction."
"<at>Aj_Tommy Listen and learn. And remember: when you call someone names, you're usually talking of yourself. Lacks intellect. Get it together."
"<at>Yayizzo Please. Mosley's gonna get slaughtered."
"<at>remotelo Appreciate ya, my man. Thanks so much."
"<at>youngwordplay"
"<at>youngwordplay Stop it, Bruh! You know better. Nobody's dissing LeBron. I'd want him on my team. But there's something to be said about"
"<at>youngwordplay and those who want the ball at those moments and those who don't."
"<at>SHERMradio We're done! I'll never talk basketball with you again for making such an idiotic statement."
"<at>Chef_ChadD CLOSE.........."
"<at>Aj_Tommy Clearly I have not blocked you. See how you look when you ASSume???"
"<at>stede5 Not true!"
"<at>KingTunji False. Not a violent man."
"By the way, I'm very saddened my boy Andre Berto lost his Welterweight title last night. But I consider him lucky: Pacquaio would've"
"Destroyed him based on the way he looked last night. At least now he can learn from his mistakes, improve his defense and come back better"
"Another day. Again,....love him to death but he's not ready for Pacman. Not yet."
"The Chris Paul that I'm seeing today has me fantasizing about him in a Knicks' uniform in two years. But not before Chauncey deserves $$$$$"
"This is a shocker. I can't believe the defense the Knicks are playing. Unbelievable"
"No matter what happens with the Knicks tonight, I've got 2 things to say: 1) I was wrong to believe they'd get blown out in Game 1 and 2) no"
"Matter what, D'Antoni did his job today. The Knicks' Defense showed the hell up!!!"
"OMG!!!!!!! Stoudamire......Stoudamire......Stoudamire. Earning every penny of that $100 mil."
"Damnit! Totally bogus call vs. Carmelo. Total Garbage. You can make that call in the final seconds of a close playoff game. TOTALLY BOGUS!"
"Check out my latest column on the NY Knicks following Game 1. It might surprise you: http://es.pn/hBIFHN"
"<at>Hateyoursuccess Your twitter name SUCKS! Change it before advising me on anything."
"<at>BiGFeF21 Nobody's infallible or perfect. Mistakes are a part of the game. Everyone has to live with them."
"<at>AngelaDF So do I. But that doesn't mean the Lakers shouldn't be alarmed. Real bad loss. Paul Gasol was a no-show."
"<at>Shap33 No about being pumped over a loss. It's learning that the Knicks can actually play defense."
"<at>jpellgen That may be true. What I'm saying is that what happened in Game 1......happened. We'll find out if it was an anomaly."
"<at>YoungRilla24 Didn't see it. Didn't hear about it."
"<at>ycmars Thank you sir!"
"<at>jaxxzun Agreed. But he's probably out for Game 2."
"<at>RadicalChild8 God Bless you, sir. Thanks for the kind words."
"<at>DavidCMacPFC But it's not....and not gonna be. Now what?"
"<at>TonyW_88 Yes Sir. I most certainly did."
"<at>IVEKILLEDPE0PLE At the moment, you're absolutely correct."
"<at>sassyandsocial Now ya know!"
"<at>dancrayfish Only immature children call it hating! I'm an analyst. It's my job to analyze -- YOUR JOB TO CHEERLEAD. Grow up!"
"<at>clickclack1 In Game 1. I predicted also the series would be highly competitive and the Knicks would lose in 5. I stand by it until wrong!"
"<at>skbeeasy Thanks. Another one coming this week."
"<at>ahmedaba27 Yes! That was me"
"A Knicks and Lakers recap will take place tonight on the Stephen A. Smith Show. First on ESPN NY 1050 from 7-9 pm EST, then on 710 ESPN LA."

"<at>Drewyang Thank you, Sir!"
"<at>Smart_Suzie thank you, sweety!"
"<at>rb3b3 Celtics!"
"<at>farhanahmed11 Hell No!"
"<at>rb3b3 if the Knicks win I head to S. Beach for the Semifinals. You don't think I'm praying I'm wron :-)"
"<at>rb3b3 Wrong:-)"
"<at>jaxxzun So long as they don't get rid of General Hospital, we're all good."
"<at>pterrance Carmelo has to watch his shot selection. Game is tight. No need to force matters."
"Are there any more questions about Melo??? Thought so!!!"
"Jared Jeffries. I think I'm going to faint :-)"
"<at>J_OZ You're insane. This is not the night to question Melo!!!"
"<at>NittiMonster Yes! But this could turn into a real series. Knicks will win Game 3. Game 4 is the series."
"<at>Rel215 Not gonna happen against this team!"
"Here's my appearance on Boston's WEEI this morning: http://audio.weei.com/a/39628907/stephen-a-smith-says-celtics-cannot-beat-the-heat.htm"
"<at>RMConte17 You're another ignorant you-know-what I'm about to cut off. I never said the Celtics have NO CHANCE. I said the injuries may be"
"<at>RMConte17 too much, and based on their struggles, they'll have no chance if they continue this way. Quote me accurately or just be quiet."

"<at>razzjazzsports They are an absolute travesty."
"<at>22canucks33 Go on line at ESPNNY.Com or ESPNLA.com......or, if you have a droid or iPhone....get the ESPN Radio App."
"<at>qbin98 Haaaaa. You know better :-)"
"<at>Mr_Fda_Approved Very good, but they can still be had b/c they don't have a shooting guard to play alongside Rose."
"<at>RealSkipBayless I'm not one of them Mr. Bayless. No way Melo's performance was better than LeBron's."
"You couldn't teach me a thing about B-Ball if Mr. Naismith HIMSELF gave you private lessons."
"And that's saying a lot since ya'll were born around the same time."
"The comedy in your rhetoric is that you actually believe the nonsense you're spewing. But I DO like Stephen NAI-smith :-)"
"Be ignorant if ya'll want. Ya'll know my man Skip could never mess with me. Never will. But he's still one of myBBF's in this industry."
"<at>KerryKB Thank ya Babygirl :-)"
"<at>MikeTeer31 Huh?"
"Just finished doing 1st Take with Jay Crawford at the top of the 2nd hour of the show. It'll re-air from Noon-to-2 pm today, so catch it."
"<at>Nick975Fanatic Sure. No problem!"
"<at>Nick975Fanatic 1:15"
"Win for Gianna bracelets. My friend Anthony Donahue's little sister was diagnosed with Brain Cancer last Summer and is recovering nicely."
"Cancer and her last day of chemo treatment in Boston is TODAY. Please lend a helping hand -- however much you can -- to assist the Donahue"
"Family in helping Gianna to a speedy recovery."
"<at>billionaire16 <at>winforGianna"
"Right now I feel like I owe all the Knicks' fans a personal apology. This is just flat-out embarrassing. Disgusting. I'm literally deflated."
"D'Antoni's starting lineup to start the 4th: Walker, Douglas, Jeffries, Williams and Fields. What the hell is this? A White Flag???"
"<at>carpy5024 yes you did! I let my emotions get the best of me for 1 game. I was wrong"
"<at>gtrizzie I hear you, my man. Despite your ignorance about my record, I'm humbled tonight. Knicks were THAT awful. I have nothing to say!"
"<at>deedsoverwords Good point."
"<at>Tandur I agree. I picked the Celtics to win this series in 5, but the Knicks to win in Game 3. Disgusting. I'm disgusted with myself."
"<at>ArtRondeau My pleasure. We all should won't to help those less fortunate than ourselves. It's pure food for the soul."
"Beautiful scene watching these boys hug Brandon Roy. He exploded in the 2nd Half. Just shows how much RESPECT his teammates have for him."

"<at>PULSARinTheDark We disagree."
"<at>TheRightRican You may have a point."
"<at>Fishyplayer Is that a problem?"
"<at>JosephRobeRT326 Shhhhhh!!!!! Stay Tuned"

"<at>timbointheapple No!"
"It's still a bit early in the process but I've got to admit I think the NFLPA is handling this lockout issue quite well thus far."

"<at>tronediddy such ignorance. There is never, ever, a story that I've written that folks have no refuted. It's called covering their <at>+#*,"

"<at>OG_Michelle All you fools are getting on my damn nerves. I said the Lakers would win in 7 and predicted they'd win Game 2. All you're"
"<at>OG_Michelle showing is that you don't listen. I'm going to start cutting all folks off for misquoting me and misrepresenting what I say."
"I expected to get crucified because I didn't pick the Mavs to win. NOT because I thought the Lakers would get swept."
"<at>SteveSolar I'm not eating anything. I said Miami wins if Shaq can't play for Boston. He hasn't played and they've lost. Period."
"<at>Godiva7108 Pretty much. They look old and worn down. Like they have nothing left. They could still win but I can't see it."
"<at>Guilain23 Major...Major props. I didn't see this coming."
"It's sad watching the Lakers go down like this, but let's get a few things out of the way: Mavs are just a better team. It's not so much"
"That Phil Jackson is getting outcoached, it's that the Lakers' arrogance has caught up to them. If everything is always about themselves and"
"Nobody else, and they feel this way playing in front of 19,000 people, what were they doing behind closed doors? In the gym? W/ their game?"
"They didn't just take their opponents for granted, they did the same with their own talents. Now, they're on the verge of getting swept and"
"Sending Phil out this way. Just an absolute shame. There's no shame in losing to Dallas. But getting swept? Shameful. They shouldn't be"
"Allowed to live this down for a long, long time."
"<at>TheGoldenGun read, listen and learn"
"Watching Kobe right now is just unbelievable. He's talking about a few mess-ups, yet acts like there is no urgency. He's not getting that"
"It's not about him. It's about what he can peel out of this team. Kobe needs to act like Hill acted tonight. To sense the moment and exhaust"

"Hard to see at all. This team will not be together next season. JUSTICE!!!"
"No matter what, I believe the Lakers will be down by 30 before this QT is even over."
"<at>CoachCunningham True!"
"This is a reminder of when the Lakers lost to the Pistons in the Finals. It's not as much about B-Ball as it is about all the distractions."
"This is the most disgraceful loss in Lakers' Franchise history. Odom ejection! Bynum ejection! Magic! Kareem! West! EVERYBODY who's ever"

"That in itself is all anyone should need to pick Dallas in this series. Especially if the game's are close. But, going with my heart again,"
"There's something telling me that Miami will return to S. Beach for Game 6 down 3-2 in this series, and LeBron and D-Wade's heart will"

"<at>Teaguejmerrill a word. You know why? Because it's none of our damn business. Certain things cross the line. Bottom line: LBJ has to get it"
"<at>Teaguejmerrill done. You don't need to know his family issues. You just need to know he'd better overcome it to get a title. Period."
"LeBron's been dealing with personal stuff for years. The only reason it's relevant now is b/c of his timid performance..possibly the worse"
"Of his career. You play this badly -- as if you're in a coma -- with his talent, that's psychological. That's not about talent or schemes."

"<at>dhoffa9 He scored in the 4th. It was a meaningless 2, but he scored. Made some great passes, though."
"Fantastic series. Major props to the Mavs. But I picked Miami in 7 and I'm not budging. That means it's guaranteed the Heat will win Game 6."
"Forget all the other talk about LeBron. To score 2-or-less points in the 4th QT of 4-straight games in the finals is EMBARASSING! It's Time!"

"Yo ya'll, I'm about to head to Baltimore for the Jets/Ravens game. I know Mark Sanchez better stay safe, and the Jets D and run-game better"

"Punks jump up to get beat down. Me and Skip Bayless on 1st Take. Right now!!!"
"Damnit, Enough! I admitted Tebow impressed me, but I'm not about to marry him like <at>RealSkipBayless has. Hell No! So much for Peace."
"In fact, I think it's time to blame Tebow for turmoil on the set of 1st Take. How else to explain <at>RealSkipBayless going at Cris Carter :-)"
"Luckily my man Cris Carter could handle himself. Otherwise I would've had to step in an officially beatdown <at>RealSkipBayless. And I'm nice:)"
"Yeah, <at>rideordietv <at>RealSkipBayless You'd think he would've given me an invitation, since he's suppose to be my boy. Guess not :-)"
"I don't hate on anybody,<at>HonorableCnote. I'm just telling it like it is. Tebow's a football player. But he's not a damn QB. Not yet. Sorry!"
"Amen,<at>stephencbishop. Preach on.......ya damn genius :-)"
"B.S. <at>stephencbishop <at>RealSkipBayless. Skip is beyond fandome. He's a damn stalker/cheerleader :-) I love him, but it's true with Tebow."
"Sorry, <at>Yup_DatsChris. Nothing but love for you. But 20 years of journalism put me in this chair. I'm not about to debate for free. sorry!"
"Thank you, <at>mklueh <at>RealSkipBayless. Both Skip and I really appreciate the love. Seriously!"
"I can't escape Tebow. I just can't escape the dude. NFL32 on ESPN2 coming at you at 6pm. And guess who's one of the subjects: Tebow! Damn!:)"
"My man, <at>goodness456, if the Knicks get a solid guard, they could end up in the Finals. We're about to find out ... http://t.co/DHL4T0OY"
"Tell that to the bosses, <at>gdubss31. I don't run the show."
"You mean FACTS, <at>robertceagle . Just the facts baby!"
"Can't do it,<at>ufcasey. Not yet!"
"Awww Damn, <at>tuzziiman1. Don't say that. Please don't wish that on me."
"Maybe it's you, <at>RLeff12"
"Nope,<at>robertceagle. I mean facts like that defense that keeps them within striking distance for the 1st 50 min he stinks up the joint."
"I agree, <at>sonicdeath84. But you're only hurting yourself. We talk about plenty of other things."
"Don't even include me in that, <at>GoodTimeGrif. I was a scrub. You do the rest of WSSU an injustice."
"Haaaaaaaaaaa, <at>TheLeakDOTnet"
"Thank you, <at>hollywoodfraz."
"Could always ball, <at>LenHaywood, until I cracked my kneecap in half. Never been the same since. It's over for me."
":-):-):-)<at>nate81_02"
"I like that discussion, <at>justflashbobbi. I really, really do."
"YOU??????????<at>TheRealDPurtell"
"I hear ya,<at>THE_Machine_24. But wins are not all that matters, when it takes more than one player."
"I really, really have no idea, <at>JamesBEASTEIN. I'm wondering about that myself."
"I truly, truly feel that way, <at>Cheps85. I believe Kobe WILL ask for a trade. How much of Jim Buss' nonsense is he suppose to take?"
"Thanks, <at>SoFlyGrant. I'm glad you recognize it."
"I'm sorry, <at>DatGurLiZpoYzuN, but it applies. He's a bit touched. A bit different. But I love Metta World Peace. He's good people."
"Nobody's doubting that, <at>notDEADenough <at>RealSkipBayless. But that doesn't make u wrong for saying he's not a starting NFL Quarterback."
"I tried my best,<at>JasonRomano. I tried my best :-)"
"I hear ya, <at>gabotamayo <at>TimTebow. And I truly wish Tebow the best. He's a wonderful dude. But I don't think he's ready yet. I just don't."
"Not a damn thing,<at>xxxjuice201xxx <at>terrellowens <at>ochocinco. They'd just be dude's CONTRIBUTING to wins. Not THE REASON their team won."
"Tell me about it, <at>jrthebossman. I didn't know what the hell he was thinking."
"I'm looking forward, <at>SedanoShow <at>ClaytonESPN <at>chrisbosh <at>NFLONFOX. Buckle up. I'll be ready."
"Haaaaaaa, did I say that, <at>SportsfanPJ? Sorry, but it was necessary, considering the way things are going. Don't know about LakeShow now."
"Skip's going to get it today. 1st Take coming at you RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Love the fact that Joe Budden is here. Real cool brother. Wish him all the best. <at>RealSkipBayless looks a little scared, but won't admit it."
"Yeah, <at>Cash_IsKing. But I'm over 40. What's his excuse!"
"A full blown, coast-to-coast edition of the Stephen A. Smith Show on ESPN Radio is coming at you tonight. Lots going on w/ the NBA/Tebow :-("
"ESPN NY (1050) from 7-9pmEST, then 710 ESPN LA from 6-8pm PST. Buckle up! I'm coming!!!"
"Otis is doing just fine, <at>DonMagicDraper. If you have Dwight Howard, you hold on for dear life until you simpy can't anymore."
"Like I told folks earlier, <at>iamSIMBOSLICE <at>SportsNation I'm over 40. so I'm over it. Don't care if I look like George Jefferson (haaaa!!!)"
"Of course we saw it,<at>tmar24. It was hilarious. I like it. Of course, <at>RealSkipBayless loves it. You know how big his ego is :-)"
"Actually,<at>djbobbykb24, <at>RealSkipBayless doesn't think they did, but I do. Love Chris Paul. His game is bigtime. Still too much, though."
"Had you commented respectfully, you would've gotten a better response,<at>GlennFromMason. But since you wanted to be a prick, keep ASS-uming!!"
"What will the Knicks have to give back,<at>luvmypiff"
"We both know it, <at>Scuddy_Buddy <at>ludacris. Nothing wrong with that. Ludacris is cool. And one look at his girl proves he has impeccable taste"
"totally true.<at>KD_SWAGGER <at>jmikeNBAusat"
"Be yourself, bro,<at>iKGeezie. It'll work."
"I don't Tebow bash, <at>diosa973. I tell the truth without wearing pom poms and people call it trashing. There's a difference."
"I feel ya, <at>jmikeNBAusat <at>KD_SWAGGER"
"Thanks for keeping in tune, <at>GiovonniStacks <at>RealSkipBayless"
"Don't worry about Jemele, <at>Twomp_thaDJ <at>jemelehill <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>RealSkipBayless. I've got 2 days. Then it's all hers."
"Not a bad idea, <at>CodyKreezy <at>Lakers <at>LakersReporter <at>espnlandolakers <at>wojyahoonba <at>daldridgetnt <at>espnsteinline <at>chris_broussard"
"1st Take coming at you RIGHT NOW!!!!"
"Thank ya,<at>EpBrian"
"Suh may be vicious on the field, but I don't think that makes him a bad guy. He's bigtime. He just can't punk out of an interview like that."
"I will NOT allow folks to twist my words/position on Tebow. It's NOT about his wins/losses with me; it's about the opportunity he's received"
"Nobody but Tebow has been accorded the level of patience and modifications he's received. I wish him luck, but it's not right. Period!!!"
"God knows, somebody has to be <at>StevenGTaylor"
"That's what I've been saying, <at>NickyHobes1322. You're refusal to absorb it that way is not my problem."
"I always answer questions,<at>Chucks93. I can't answer thousands of questions a day. Gotta work."
"Thanks,<at>Korey_W"
"Replay what I said,<at>eyengardner. Listen intently. Then come back to me."
"Didn't say that yet, <at>KuttingEdgeBarb. What I said is that they're a better show."
"I'm honored and privileged ONCE AGAIN to have been invited on NFL32 on ESPN2. Love talking Football. Hope ya'll are watching."
"Puh-leeze,<at>timmyzabs"
"Thank you,<at>MarcellusSuede"
"Do your homework,<at>DoneMeRite. You'll find out that one sport doesn't limit me. Listen! Learn!"
"I said he will,<at>kiddCharlemagne. Doesn't mean it will happen. Quote me accurately!"
"Appreciate the comments,<at>dhaisley"
"And I love ya back,<at>msquinn28"
"Thank you,<at>hammerlegit. Appreciate the love!"
"Yes, it is<at>davidfunk74"
"Nope,<at>michaelfronk. I act like I feel EXACTLY what I've said. Your willingness to misinterpret what I say doesn't CHANGE what I've said."
"Simple,<at>Mr_Machismo86. I'm not as annoyed."
"Thank You,<at>BrenMcB88"
"Thanks,<at>jamesacosta3"
"Don't know about that, but I certainly try to be <at>JPreach_1"
"Thanks, <at>Darkmarkk . Much appreciated."
"Kobe's not going anywhere,<at>RO_Thornhill. But that's not going to stop him from asking, considering how disgusted he'll end up being w/ BUSS"
"<at>Hilltop21 Semfinals of Conference."
"Haaaaaaaa,<at>LeGacyLft14"
"<at>hmstewart77 Yep!"
"Thanks,<at>OfficialNatStar. Appreciate ya!"
"Haaaa,<at>JBo_87. You might be right :-)"
"There's a new sheriff in LA, folks.: http://t.co/wCkxu6Wr"
"The joke would be YOU for not listening, <at>Leonsden24. I said ""I BELIEVE"" Kobe will want out because of BUSS and what he's doing. Period."
"It is not my problem <at>Leonsden24 if ya'll twist my words. Comprehend ENGLISH. Stop twisting my words. Listen. And remember what I said."
"I know, <at>BrysonBell1. But that doesn't mean he won't ASK for it."
"Puh-Leeze,<at>TATTOOART01"
"The Stephen A. Smith Show on ESPN LA (710) is coming at you at the top of the hour. We're discussing Chris Paul, Kobe, NFL/Tebow and more."
"Feel free to tweet me right here or call in at 877.710.3776. Lakers' Coach Mike Brown is on LIVE at the top of the hour."
"Appreciate the email and the support, <at>BlackBlonde7. Thanks so much."
"It's not really Tebow-bashing, <at>cody_swann <at>walkdesign. I'm just tired of talking about the man. Enough Already. I need Brady to end this."
"I honestly don't know what to say about that, <at>cringehumor <at>KimKardashian. Can't play yourself on a reality show. She is KK, afterall :-)"
"Of course I don't,<at>LKRGIRL. But that doesn't mean they won't be by the end of the season."
"To listen to my radio show, <at>RealKenyelAli, go to ESPN New http://t.co/Amyg4H67 or ESPN http://t.co/PbRrKqVh."
"The Clippers are definitely a playoff team with Chris Paul, <at>Marty2634"
"Yes, dear,<at>Twixit_N_Mixit. Some people are."
"Skip BASELESS in LIVE from Denver today to support Tebow. I think I may take the villain role to a whole new level. 1st Take at 10am. HOLLA!"
"That's good to know, <at>terrellowens. Now, I'd appreciate it if you'd stop confusing me w/ Skip BASELESS. He's the 1 who said u were done!"
"You're exactly right,<at>football_fan22"
"Oh Puh-leeze,<at>Alexis_daddy. Stop it!"
"Watch your tongue, <at>BeTrueAllDay23."
"I hear ya, <at>JC_Webb"
"Screw them, <at>CStaccz. I got your back :-)"
"I agree,<at>asalemi1"

"Thanks, my man<at>asalemi1"
"Works for me, <at>DREAL_ONE"
"This is my last day of this 2-week stint on 1st Tebow -- I mean 1st Take. And there's no way I'm departing quietly. I don't give a frogs fat"
"You know what about SKIP BASELESS being in Denver to do the show with all those Tebow lovers. I don't care if he's backed by an army."
"Enough of this already. Let's get it on. All you Tebow lovers. Bring it! 1st Take in the house on ESPN2. I'll Show up. Will ya'll????"
"Thanks, <at>VinnyZane. Appreciate ya!"
"Impossible,<at>michaelc1089"
"Thankfully, this is my last day, <at>terrym0516. I'm TEBOWED out!"
"No sir, <at>RockaRudeSki. Just stating facts!"
"You are so ignorant, <at>tlmoon2112. It's a shame that there are people who think like you in this world, ignoring facts at every whim."
"Amen to that,<at>KristaMarie84"
"Everyone knows this but Skip, <at>Bric875"
"Don't tempt me,<at>TLLayman"
"Yes I am, <at>ADRIAN1000CC_R1"
"Gotta say, sitting here watching the Knicks vs Nets, I'm liking what I see from rookies Schumpert and Harrelson. ... http://t.co/JzeCd8U7"
"Exactly,<at>giantsfan719"
"They could certainly use him right now, <at>Natedubs000"
"I like what I'm seeing from him, <at>Cerse"
"Thank you for the correction, <at>AdnanKukuljacNY"
"Not sure, <at>NatBurner003. But I DO think the Knicks deserve the benefit of the doubt right now. Let's give them a chance."
"Bigtime scorer, <at>zackniles23. You can tell."
"Difficult to say with his salary, <at>Tyrewith1E"
"Everybody's entitled to their opinion, <at>thefuneralpyre. I'm on 19 Years and counting. Tell those folks to feel free to hate away. God Bless"
"The two subjects don't even belong being mentioned together, <at>sexysportsfan. Why do that? Not fair to anybody."
"Thank you, <at>iamDMiller . Appreciate the love."
"Couldn't agree with you more<at>giantsfan719 ,"
"Thank you, <at>LivingNTheSun"
"Not at all, <at>Decipher812. Kobe will be just fine. And his supposed divorce is none of anyone's business. I refuse to address it!"
"Hey, if ya'll are serious about your health, about REALLY FEELING BETTER check out JJ Smith's new book: http://t.co/GthBZIgW. The Real Deal."
"I would know. I met here before. Her advice to me helped me drop my cholesterol 73 points in six weeks W/O medication. Trust me. She's IT!!!"
"I'm good, <at>Darksecrettt. Another Sunday I need to get ready for."
"Nope <at>IH8cornandcolts"

"Patriots,<at>cherall1224. Who else?"
"If at all is most appropriate, <at>Paney89. A.I. Needs to be out there showcasing his talents, reminding teams he's still got a game!"
"Hell Yes,<at>EauRouger"
"I picked the Eagles to win today, but this is just a damn DISGRACEFUL performance by the Jets. So ill-prepared. Don't deserve playoffs."
"And the Giants are even worse. If Tom Coughlin loses his job after this season, look no further than their loss today as a huge reason why!"
"Btw.......it's not an accident that I didn't mention Tim Tebow. Let's just say, win, lose or draw, I'm happy I'm not on 1st Take until Wed."
"Can't take another minute of Skip BAYLESS' mouth. Just can't do it. Need a break!"
"I repeat: I will NOT be on 1st Take Monday or Tuesday. Not on the show again until Wednesday. Hopefully, Tebow will lose today."
"Thanks, <at>KoreyWitaK. Really appreciate the retweet."
"I can't take him anymore, <at>Fuc_Republicans. The more he wins, the more I have to listen to Skip Bayless. No man deserves this torture."
"Thank you, <at>MARKCURRY. Appreciate the love, bruh! Miss seeing ya. Catch you at a Lakers' game down the line, I'm sure."
"Amen,<at>KGWSports. Ridiculous."
"Appreciate the tweet, <at>CaptainClark17. Thanks. Keep'em coming."
"No need for such language,<at>iPapi_4G. But I appreciate you agreeing with me. Thanks."
"Ya man looked very good today, <at>lala. Seems in good shape. Jumper looked good. And he's leading. Knicks will benefit bigtime from this:-)"
"UNLEASH!!! All he does is win games..all....all he does is win games."" -- NOT!!! I DON'T THINK SO. Now can we get back to talking FOOTBALL??"
"And btw.......let's give Tom Brady the credit he deserves. He's truly BIGTIME! Worthy of BRADY-MANIA! But we won't go there. Unnecessary!"
"<at>FerRuiz90 oh! But Skip's love affair with Tebow makes him a paragon of professionalism, huh? You Tebow lovers are something else."
"Oh no,<at>Dru512. Don't whine and moan now. I've had to listen to ya'll gloating for weeks. Take this and shut your mouth. Deal with it."
"Let us pray, <at>NewPort_Hendrix"
"I don't play fantasy B-Ball, <at>nate_velazquez. I leave that to you guys."
"I don't need to speak,<at>P_Rice85. Tom Brady did my talking for me."
"EXACTLY, <at>fvangrol. EXACTLY!"
"Flacco, <at>OSUBUCKS35"
"Actually, I'm glad I'm not on, <at>sKatENastY_Jay. I'm going to enjoy watching Skip trying to explain all of this, because we know he will try"
"Welcome to the mecca, <at>Baron_Davis. Can't wait!"
"Folks are allowed to dream, <at>justsanaa :-)"
"I'm in there on Wednesday, <at>Donnie_Peters. I didn't want to be there today. Wanted Skip to suffer for a couple of days. Know what's coming!"

"The Stephen A. Smith Show is coming at you in DRIVETIME for the rest of the year! I'll be filling for Michael Kay ... http://t.co/TTxNZ4ht"
"You know I will, <at>KimberleyLocke. Miss ya much. Keep doing your thang!!! Happy Holidays."
"And the American people will lose, yet again, <at>CNN. At some point, we'll all get serious."
"I'm buying, <at>Ludacris <at>SoulbyLudacris <at>radioshack. Happy Holidays."
"Can't wait.<at>terrellowens. We need you back to finish off the last years of your career right :-) It's about that time."

"Haaaaaaa,<at>chef1998. Must be talking to a Lakers' fan!"
"I heard they did already, <at>TS51077. But Otis Smith's going to wait until before the trading deadline. Either way, he's got to tradeD-Howard"
"I'm always speaking that way,<at>BigChunks45. Just because folks refuse to accept it doesn't make it false."
"Fyi...I'll be back on 1st Take on ESPN2 tomorrow morning to go up against my man Skip Bayless. I sincerely hope he's off Tebow. We pray:-)"
"I plan to tomorrow morning, <at>bscottiex3"
"Anything's possible<at>RyanSParker. But please understand: If D-Howard swears he's not re-signing with someone, then no one will trade for him"
"No doubt, <at>MrKushUpzz"
"Amen! <at>antdupree <at>Twixit_N_Mixit"
"Is there another way,<at>Twixit_N_Mixit???"
"We'll see, <at>Fisheplaya"
"Nah, <at>ALLCAPSBRO. Skip loves Brady, too."
"Clearly, you haven't been paying attention, my dear <at>lisalewis18. But remember one thing: I don't have to anymore. Did it for 19 years."
"Just heard about it 2 hours ago, <at>phatrobbie. Shocking."
"If you mean New Jersey, <at>KingTutBuddha, there's a big chance."
"Always,<at>Ravensdfens"
"Nope, <at>AnimatedThinker"
"haaaaa, <at>leonperth"
"Thanks, <at>HunterReveur. Really appreciate the kind words. Seriously!"
"Not true, <at>EELewy11. The <at>RealSkipBayless Skip Bayless is a lot of things, but he ain't that."
"Glad I can entertain ya'll,<at>TS51077. Tell all of your fellas I said ""What up!"""
"Noooooooooo,<at>K_Hood. Please don't tell me that."
"I don't mind talking about Tebow, <at>birdybirdyquad. But it should be 1 or 2 topics, not THE SHOW. I'm just not sold on Tebow. Period."
"We'll see if that's the case this year, <at>ChuyNLakewood"
"Ugh,<at>GExpose. Was okay, but wasn't THAT funny to me."
"I believe J. Kidd is an elite pg when it matters most,<at>seankalub"
"You need to be drug tested,<at>wiscotrav"
"We'll only touch on it once or twice,<at>sharplowdown. It won't be the whole show or half of it. Promise."
"No good comes from wishing harm on another human being, <at>Dru512. I'm gonna pray for you!"
"Good one, <at>Chrisguadalupe"
"Yes Sir,<at>EVANGELO_22"
"On 1st Take, I'm making my NBA-Final Four Predictions today -- who'll meet in the Conference Finals. Plus, <at>RealSkipBayless will pick Finals"
"I like the brother, <at>HOODESSENCE, but that's just disgraceful. It's the kind of thing that upset D-Howard."
"Not true, <at>Thikkblooded_09. Too bad you didn't listen."
"And we love ya back, <at>OnACougheeBreak"
"Don't stop,<at>kingraj6"

"Yeah <at>RealSkipBayless, what's up with that. Why are you NOT following me.<at>BenBartos"
"There's a lot folks don't know about me, <at>ScubaDice13. Just like everyone was shocked I knew a little Politics."
"He can't do it alone, <at>SLICKREDDG"
"I've got mad respect for the 49ers, <at>rtcjr79. Especially Harbaugh. But it should not have taken Harbaugh to make Alex Smith a QB!"
"Thanks, bro!<at>jmccallahan"

"Nope, <at>zahzoom. Let Skip BASELESS wait. And suffer :-)"
"Thanks you,<at>princedia100"
"Right back at ya!!!"
"This is what you have to be concerned about in D'Antoni's system. Shumpert looking for own shot a bit too much. Everyone has green light."
"Not good. Amar'e likes to be fed when he's on the floor. Nothing major at the moment, but worth keeping our eyes on."
"That much is aboutely true,<at>michaelsaleh732"
"Don't like Amar'e shooting 3's,<at>FeLdYsTyLe. But I hear ya!!!"
"I also need to see Amar'e's post game. So far, it's non-existent. Unimpressive."

"Who's the man in New York City. Take a look at who's NOT:......http://es.pn/s7GRA4."

"I'm getting very disgusted damnit! The Knicks played good D for one quarter, now look at them. And this is w/o Boston having Pierce. Damnit!"
"Mind you, we haven't even gotten to the offense. Amar'e dribbling. Horrid passing! No structure whatsoever. A 21-2 run by SUBS. Damn!"

"Gotta admit, this 49ers Defense is Hellified impressive."

"A Game like this is suppose to come down to the Saints offense vs. 49ers Defense. Love it!"
"Big-time play by Brees and Graham. Now hear this: if the Saints let ALEX SMITH drive down the field on them, they don't deserve the win."
"Saints do not deserve to win this game. Great throw by Alex Smith,.......but still!!!!!!!!!"
"That's what happens when you play NOT TO LOSE on defense. But I'm not taking anything away from ALEX SMITH. He showed me something today!"

"<at>angiemocha1 Always!"
"<at>A_Tsak Yes!"
"<at>blueharris79 Always!"
"And I won't miss you one bit,<at>Packrfans12. It's weak peeps like you who define DISSENTING opinions as RACE who keep is down. Good Riddance!"
"I'll keep trying, <at>DopeCap_860. But you know my man <at>RealSkipBayless needs prayer :-)"
"Not the winning streak itself, <at>bgg11104. The change in their personnel."
"<at>cagematic Yes!"
"<at>Charlies_World_ Happy Birthday Bro!"
"<at>Young_Skip Appreciate the love Babygirl!"
"I notice everyone keeps talking about how the Knicks should acquire Nash! No doubt. No.1 option. But how about Goren Dragic? He'll be free!"
"<at>B_lovedd Never saw it. Tweet me a link if you can!"
"I love my boy Charles Barkley. But I just saw that Weight Watchers commercial of him in a dress. Disgusting!:-) I'm sorry Chuck :-)"

"Your loss!<at>jasonwestman"
"For those hyped about the Knicks, perhaps you should pause for a second: http://t.co/a95RHSik."
"Was told my last link on the Knicks didn't work. Here's the one that does, http://t.co/a95RHSik,... Check it out."
"<at>Pomar_Rodriguez Nope! Said it before acquisitions were made. Doesn't count!"
"<at>cbrax23 who said I didn't see the Spurs as contenders?"
"<at>bryan_milliard because it's about the end of the REGULAR season."
"Damn Skippy :-)<at>FIREFOX___"
"Oh Stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless, You don't get to REVISIT the SB. Your Patriots lost. Plain and simple. Suck it up and deal with it! :-)"
"Wrong Stephen A, Bruh! <at>SteelHeel40. Especially when I'm confronted by ignorance."
"I like Ozzie, <at>Legyptian. But it was stupid for him to say that. I just hope it doesn't get him fired!"
"Yes Sir, <at>heisFree. I most certainly did."
"Don't you dare forget to add these last 2 words, <at>RealSkipBayless: FOR NOW!"

"You can FEEL what you want, <at>90sKnicksFans. Doesn't make you right. Just ignorant, and publicly so. But that's what you wanted! Enjoy ur 15"
"What the hell is going on here. The Knicks actually look like they're trying to win this game. Oops. Forgot. Rose is out. Should be a win!"
"I don't know what the hell is wrong with Novak. He's hitching on his shots, like he's hesitants. Bulls' defenders ... http://t.co/twBAAAZp"
"You're right, <at>ah1144. They could beat the Knicks tonight w/o Rose!"
"We may not know the outcome of this game but we do know this: The Knicks 1st Half was BUTT UGLY, and we do not want to see NY/Chi in 1st Rd."
"Damn! Damn! Damn! Anyone complaining about my column now on http://t.co/bfTyzLZD today now??? Damnit!"
"See ya'll on 1st Take tomorrow with my man <at>RealSkipBayless on ESPN2. I'll save my disgust until then."
"I'm actually scared about today's 1st Take. I'm going to do my thing, but Jalen Rose and <at>RealSkipBayless are going 1-on-1 on Skip's career!"
"Stay tuned! Sometimes you've got to fall back and let folks handle their business. Again, I'm here. Ready to do my thing. But Skip? Whew!"
"Pay attention, <at>RashadMLawrence. I'm not taking any position on Skip and Jalen. I'm discussing Journalism, as it relates to what Jalen said"
"Jalen's my man. Always will be. Love'em! The only thing that pissed me off about him was that he kept interrupting ... http://t.co/imm8sxwO"
"About to go on Sportscenter at 12:20. Make sure to check it out."

"<at>KB_Masterpiece Turn the channel, bro! You won't be missed!"
"<at>seeehorn I guess a shock jock who can host his own radio and TV shows and still write columns."
"Teach! <at>em_mighty. Because ignorant folks are accusing me of not giving OTHERS a chance to talk. That's completely untrue!"
"Haaaaa, <at>WilliamOwsley. I'm going for the George Jefferson look. I'm not ashamed :-)"

"<at>Rickthird You know better, no matter what you say."
"<at>WhereMyCookies Folks want to be lied to. Sad!"
"<at>CWill_574 Yes he could. Mad respect for that. But this is MY PROFESSION. This ain't the court. Different domain here. Don't forget that!"

"<at>joseph3633 Thank you!"
"<at>richarddummett Actually, he didn't in this game. You're going by what you watch on TV. I'm an INSIDER. I KNOW! So listen. Respect the email"
"Good, <at>jejack100. My pleasure. Because I'm not changing!"
"<at>wrdply That's a great line, Bruh! I might use that :-)"
"<at>nysportsglory Nope! That part is over."
"<at>MiCA_J_D And he loves ya back :-)"

"Hold it down, bruh, <at>D_Walk like I know you can."
"Hold it down, bruh, <at>D_Walk. like I know you can."
"What a Game. Miami had LeBron open in the post, but ran the play for Wade. They didn't want to give LBJ the ball. Bulls 10/18 FT's. Shameful"
"I've seen enough. LBJ's Body language. His-and-Wade's disgust with their bench. Spoelstra's lack of trust in the Bench. MIAMI IS IN TROUBLE!"
"I'm talking their championship aspirations, not the regular season. Just to be clear!"
"<at>Acline_47 :-):-):-)"
"Haaaa, <at>funntiest1. My grammar! Child Puh-leeze!"
"Because they hate you anyway, <at>Kelvinonthelaw. The disagreeing part is just an excuse they use to express the venom they're dying to spew."

"<at>larsarz333 I had no problems with Wade's comments. He's entitled to feel what he wants."

"<at>NYRYE27 Thanks bro!"
"<at>Mick_Nastee rushing, returning tweets, mistakes are gonna happen. Such is life."
"<at>2ndtakeonthebac Exactly! Not true! Meaning what you think."

"Disgusting! <at>RealSkipBayless"
"<at>bpeevy78 You love to HATE me? I'm going to pray for you brother. Incredibly sad! Even worse, ur thinking it fazes me when it should faze U!"
"<at>OverseasCash I might one day soon. Too much idiocy."
"I am NOT on 1st Take until Wednesday. I will NOT be on tomorrow. My man <at>RealSkipBayless will hold it down. No worries."
"<at>andredyrell I press reply and just have what's there."
"<at>RedMamba4 Watch me Wednesday. I could whisper and peeps like you would still complain. No matter!"
"<at>RedMamba4 Totally agree. But I was the exception. Probably b/c I NEVER talk when it's time to perform, when it's primetime. Always ready!"
"Before ya'll even ask, I heard what Ryan Clark just said about me. I'll deal with his comments on Wednesday. So sorry it's necessary!"
"And Btw.......he's already in trouble. I never -- ever -- said athletes don't have degrees. I've fought FOR athletes for decades. Research!"
"I care nothing about his comments on my hairline. I'm in my mid-40's. Keep telling ya'll, I'm over it. George Jefferson is my idol :-)"
"Could the Knicks make serious trouble with Melo and a HEALTHY Amar'e. Find out: http://t.co/kKSzM1hP."

"Fyi..I meant what I said with my explanation pertaining to Ryan Clark today. But with all the attention, I'm ASHAMED of my last ""Kiss"" line."
"No need for all of this. Myself and Ryan will handle it amongst ourselves a men. But I wanted to personally APOLOGIZE for my part in this!"
"We can all go at each other, but not like this. There's enough Black-on-Black ""crime"" going on. I'm a grown man. I should know better."
"No matter how right I am with the facts, I was WRONG to add that last line. Weak, weak moment on my part. Plain and simple."
"Made me no better than him."
"Thanks Bro!"

"<at>DJAYFRESHMAKER when you allow one side to convince you the other hate you, we marginalize ourselves. One side takes you for granted."
"<at>DJAYFRESHMAKER and then the other side gives you the proverbial finger because they know you've been convinced they're the villains."
"<at>DJAYFRESHMAKER Then they all stand around and get paid, laughing to the bank on tax payer dime and ignorance b/c our EMOTIONS got us."
"<at>DJAYFRESHMAKER Good, bad or ugly, I believe there isn't a thing you can say about one side that you can't say about the other. That's why"

"<at>IAMTarheel Actually, I'd feel ecstatic. I have no problem admitting when I'm wrong. If necessary w/ the Knicks, I'd be happy to do so."
"There was no excuse for that elbow by MWP on Harden, <at>johnnythefreaky. Definitely warranted an ejection. Suspension is forthcoming."
"Gotta tell y'all, I'm here at this Lakers/OKC Game and I've never seen Westbrook look this bad or Durant disappear like this. Very bad!"
"Now......that last layup by Westbrook is more like it. That's what I'm accustomed to seeing from him."
"2.3 seconds left. Time for Durant!"
"I'm not going to lie, <at>DreSkeeze. I'm inclined to believe they're not ready, myself!"
"That would be true, <at>mrgreen3054. The thought is sickening!"
"Of all the sickening things that occurred today, nothing outweighs Westbrook making <at>RealSkipBayless look like a damn prophet. Disgusting!"
"<at>TFerg_3 I did NOT say it was accidental."
"That's it. I've heard it all. <at>RealSkipBayless is certifiably INSANE. Keep telling y'all: He should be Banned from talking basketball."

"#ESPN New York 1050 AM will be broadcast on 98.7 FM beginning at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday, the station announced.   http://t.co/8l9lNQM1  "
"<at>Offically100 Mercer's Kitchen near Tribeca. She'll love it."
"Yes! It's true. I will now be on ESPN NY (1050) every weekday from 1-3pm with Ryan Rucco. But that's not the only news that's coming. :-)"
"<at>NUTTYxPROFESSOR :-)"
"<at>losandyas Not with all the new opportunities I have coming my way. Plus, Rucco is good. Stop that!"
"<at>Billitomarotta Hey, I'm reaching out to say hello. Say thank you to <at>carolinekipnis. I would not have done it had she not smiled and asked."
"<at>king72331 Possibly. Because of his defense."
"<at>CeloCRF Thank You!"
"<at>bfdaniels1 Not when it counts!"
"<at>MrEricVega Thanks!"
"<at>MannyX1287 Absolutely!"
"<at>NJDEV89 Haaaaa! You wish!"
"<at>Brooklyn_Ike All I can do is what I DO. And you can trust I'm going to do ME. But Rucco is a great kid w/ tremendous talent. We'll be fine!"
"<at>brothatrain That's precisely what I've said!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a ROMP! The Knicks are getting owned. LBJ is killin! Refs aren't helping. But it's only the 1st Half."
"To be fair to the Knicks, though, Chandler is sick as a dog and playing like it with 7 TO's in the half. But still 32.4 percent FG. Damn!!!"
"Let's not get it twisted though. Regardless of how sick Chandler is, this is embarrassing. No effort whatsoever. At least not yet. BAD!!!"
"Mind you, this annihilation is taking place with the players knowing Woodson's future's on the line and could depend on these playoffs."
"OMG No!!!!!!!! Iman Shumpert just went down. Grabbing his left knee. He can't walk. They have to carry him off. Series just ended. Damn!"
"There will be plenty of moments where we may have reasons to question LeBron during these playoffs. This isn't one of them. Phenonmenal."
"Melo! That's another matter entirely.  Especially after this performance. Amar'e too!"
"Good morning! About to be on Sportscenter today -- all day -- starting at 10:30. Lots of NBA Talk to get into. My heart aches for DRose."
"So everyone knows, when ESPN officially becomes 98.7 FM tonight, I'LL be the 1st voice you hear. Coming on from Midnight to 1am. Kicking off"
"<at>MyNYSports Haaaaaa! Hopefully, I won't make that mistake but let's be real: would you blame me? :-)"
"<at>pablopascuali I don't BASH anyone. Nor do I isolate. I call things as I see them, regardless of who it is. That's my job. Period."
"<at>pablopascuali I don't care that the Knicks got blown out. It's just one game. I DO CARE that Shumpert is injured and they have no PG."
"<at>Dj_Eclectic Doubt it!"
"<at>FrankieGOHARD I wasn't playing at all."
"<at>RCCola_85 Goodbye!"
"<at>TheMattSmothers Boston!"
"<at>JRocc2100 Love the Bulls. Mad respect for them. But they're not winning w/o DRose."

"<at>Dieseldagreat98 How about his son actually coaching a few games. You don't have a problem with that?"
"Btw....Andrew Bynum is impressive today. Playing the way a big man is suppose to play. Can't hate on that!"
"<at>AGreen1575 I stand by everything I said. I still had them losing in 5 or 6. What's the problem?"
"I'll be talking Knicks playoffs, plus all of thise weekend's games at midnight on ESPN New York. Any-and-all NBA lovers are welcomed!"

"<at>Peaceinpali no disrespect but that's an idiotic question. You don't get places in this life w/o reading!"
"Knicks playing a solid game. Melo's flowing. And they're STILL losing in double-digits. And LeBron is warming up. Damn! Damn! Damn!"
"<at>RealSkipBayless There is no dawn! Damnit!"
"I'm so annoyed right now I can't even put it into words. Yeah! I knew the Knicks would lose. But I can't believe it's falling apart this way"
"<at>Jmedina49 name-calling is unacceptable. I'd get fired if I said what I really wanted to say to your punk <at>$#."

"<at>Buckeyefanatic2 don't ya think they've got their hands full with the Clippers?"
"<at>ajurich12 I really don't care!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the way this is looking Sugar Shane is about to get KNOCKED OUT for the first time in his career."
"Btw......stay tuned for me and <at>RealSkipBayless to go at it during the Mayweather/Cotto fight!"
"Oh Gawd! Am I really suppose to feel flattered that <at>RealSkipBayless mention me and Tiago Splitter in same breath?"
"I don't care that Sugar Shane is still standing/throwing. He's taking too much punishment. This could end badly!"
"<at>RealSkipBayless did ya see Floyd just sending the pace. Moving side-to-side. Hitting with the job. We already see  the superior boxer. FMJ"
"<at>RealSkipBayless no way. Floyd won 1st Rd 10-9."
"<at>RealSkipBayless I'd give that Round 2 to Cotto. Connected with a flurry earlier on, even though FMJ started eating him up late."
"3rd Round went to Floyd, <at>RealSkipBayless. All of Cotto's blows were blocked. Floyd rolled with all of them."
"Now do you not see who's landing the harder, cleaner shots, <at>RealSkipBayless. Cotto caught him with a few shots. But not enough."
"10-9 Floyd!"
"Round 5: Mayweather. Cotto's leaning, but Floyd is rolling punched them catching Cotto.  10-9 Floyd."
"Round 6: Cotto bloodies Floyd's nose. Catched Floyd with a couple of solid shots to the body as well. Could be getting interesting!"
"Cotto 10-9 <at>RealSkipBayless."
"It's getting closer <at>RealSkipBayless. Cotto's defense is impressive. So is his job. Cotto 10-9 in Round 7."
"<at>RealSkipBayless, I don't know what the hell Mayweather is doing early in Round 8. Doesn't make sense to me."
"Round 8: Definitely went to Mayweather, <at>RealSkipBayless. This is now a TIED fight. What the hell!"
"Round 9 goes to Mayweather, <at>RealSkipBayless. He connected more, fended Cotto off. But Cotto does look supremely confident. We'll see."
"Round 10 went to Mayweather, <at>RealSkipBayless. Cotto took rounds 9 and 10 off."
"<at>RealSkipBayless Stop it. Mayweather's picked up the pace and it's Cotto who's run out of gas. Though, If Cotto wins Round 12, up 4 grabs!"
"<at>RealSkipBayless Mayweather closed baby! Floyd handled his business. I got Floyd winning the fight 116-113. Cotto lost last 3 Rounds."
"I'm about to be on Sportscenter now, then again after 12 Noon, then again at 2pm."
"Knicks win the series? Oh, that's hysterical http://t.co/LU0V34cL"
"<at>Hilltop21 Absolutely! Positively! Without question."
"<at>GradyTres I liked seeing Mayweather getting hit by a bigger man. Still unfazed. He's the best. Period."
"<at>BlaqEcko nobody in their right man would say we DON'T want Phil Jackson."
"<at>GabeNickel9 Sorry! No chance of that happening!"
"<at>SaLs_World I don't HATE on anyone. I just refuse to expend energy trying to be PC when the simple truth will do. Don't waste folks time!"

"Sorry we had to call out Jeremy Lin a little bit, but it was necessary. The dude should be able to give the Knicks some minutes. I'm sorry!"
"<at>LAUGHLOVEMILLZ didn't like it at all."
"<at>Agnosic187 Was alluding to his talents as a THROWING QB, nothing more!"

"As for the Lakers tonight, Kobe was exactly right to call out Bynum and Gasol. And if Bynum doesn't show up and they lose, he may be gone!"
"However, I don't agree with Magic Johnson that Mike Brown will be gone if they lose. Jim Buss is too cheap right now to make that move."

"<at>Vinny210 <at>tre0624 <at>RealSkipBayless Never lied a day in my career. You want to dislike us, so you create that B.S. in your head. shame!"
"<at>Vinny210 <at>tre0624 <at>RealSkipBayless Only in the last 2 minutes. Let LeBron handle the first 46 minutes."
"<at>TheKid_DTriggs Thanks bro. But I'm pursing greatness."
"<at>LawrenceMarbury Thank you, sir."
"<at>Rick_P <at>KingJames Yep."
"<at>OhdatzTinZ <at>RealSkipBayless Bias towards what?"
"<at>Matthew_J_Watso Absolutely positively got to get there."
"<at>JustinG1286 <at>RyanRuocco  Question was started by acknowledging LBJ's on the list right now. Listen!"
"<at>Real_Deal26 always."
"<at>LBJFanInNYC <at>RyanRuocco <at>WindhorstESPN I'll check it out."
"<at>HDBleu_Blase Just did :-)"
"<at>DJFairley205 did you watch First Take today."
"<at>RckyB ESPN New York (98.7FM) in New York. Go to http://t.co/GzuTU9dW"
"I told ya'll what would happen to the Heat tonight. Now I'm telling ya'll they will amp it up another level and win Game 4. D-Wade explodes!"
"<at>Tiffy_Tots I'm even scared to think about it!"
"<at>ThatManCam Stop Whining!"
"<at>bigrobdIII I have and I will. Have no choice."
"<at>fabufive :-)"
"<at>Salis707 :-)"
"I'm not going to lie: I need to keep my cool right now. I'm very, very scared of what I'm going to say about the Heat on 1st Take tomorrow."
"<at>TheCoryRadest Because the truth hurts!"
"1st Take hasn't even started yet and already <at>RealSkipBayless is trippin! On D-Wade. On LeBron. On Kobe. No worries, though. I'm here!"
"I win yet another bet vs <at>RealSkipBayless . Told him LA would win this game, even if I gave him the Pts. I live to educate this man :-)"
"I know I said this Spurs/Clips series is over -- and that they'd be lucky to win again, but a 24-0 run? 13-straight miss shots? Embarrassing"
"<at>Ardit59 Yes! Just have to raise up and make sure the Pacers know they will NOT be punked! Enough of this."
"<at>prophitjohn Spoelstra's a good young coach. Talent on this level shouldn't come down to coaching. Everyone knows what they need to do."
"<at>LukeStereotypes Yes Sir!"
"<at>The_Real_IJM jealous?"
"Win, lose or draw, I've got to admit: <at>RealSkipBayless is right to some degree about Westbrook. 5 damn possessions. Not a peak at Durant!"
"Let me say this about the Westbrook Turnover: I'm here. The changing of the floors makes things moist. He's slipped several times."
"Gasol? Absolutely, positively no excuse! Had a wide-open shot. Shouldn't have passed it. It's over now!!!"
"Saturday Night Live spoofed me last night. And I got to admit: it was damn HILARIOUS! Loved it! Hysterical!!!"
"<at>SolaidbacAlways they're too afraid of that, Bro!!!"
"<at>gatormann52 Always give colleagues credit. If someone is good enough to work with, they're good enough to respect"
"<at>BGene5187 Thank You"
"<at>Stephen57YOLO actually, I don't sing. I just listen"
"<at>mmayo17 who gives a damn!"
"SAS - Today is TebowFreeTV. Skip won the Webby, now he can’t talk Tebow. Let’s see how long he can hold out. http://t.co/rEPvHX9z  "
"LeBron and D-Wade explodes. Metta World Peace chimes in. And <at>RealSkipBayless has a problem with it. Surprise! Surprise! 1st Take is coming!"
"Right Now!!!!!!!"
"Playing Host today, folks. Me and <at>RealSkipBayless. Talking Miami, NFL, Iverson, and more. Buckle up. We're on right now!!!!"
"I see everyone is talking about my spoof. Hilarious!!!!"
"Yes, he is making me do this. But I'm loving it :-)"
"<at>optoutreplay Haaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!"
"Gotta give credit where it's due: <at>RealSkipBayless was absolutely correct. Wade was sensational and Miami closed. I'm not complaining :-)"
"<at>MrBpiffin I look good, bro. I'm good. And I don't give a damn about how another man thinks I look. I don't flow that way."
"<at>fkjrpanther13 Thank you, bro."
"<at>oboogy422 <at>jalenrose I'm on in New York on 98.7FM right now and everyday from 1-3pm"

"<at>phillymademe Stop it!"
"I am sitting her watching the Rangers/Devils Hockey Game. Tied 2-2 with 14:50 left. What the Hell is this world coming to <at>RyanRuocco :-)"
"Won't happen :-)"
"<at>dclazshow I'm trying to figure out who told you I give a damn about whether you like me or not :-)"
"<at>MrWare21 We're professionals!"

"<at>MightyJChrist"
"Sometimes, everybody's an expert, <at>MightyJChrist. A Dead Clock is right twice a day!"
"<at>ga_cream Thank You!"
"<at>GieCode I'm never unprepared!"
"<at>eazyb28 No!"
"Gotta admit, I don't like what I'm seeing from the Celtics right now. It's early, but they're already looking sluggish and sporadic."
"However, I did say that Brandon Bass and Pietras would be key and it's sure looking that way!"
"W/ 4:16 left Paul Pierce just fouled out. Things could get very interesting."
"Correction: Rondo."
"<at>Ian44134 Didn't jump on anything. I picked the Heat to get to the Finals from Day 1 -- before a game was played!"
"Yes they are, <at>RealSkipBayless. We've waited long enough!"
"Right back at you, <at>RealTracyMorgan. Keep doing what you do."
"JESUS! Tiago Splitter is just pathetic at the FT line. HORRIBLE!!!"
"Tiago makes my boy Shaq looj like Ray Allen or Reggie Miller. Damn!"
"Fyi......1st Take is being moved to ESPNews at 10 due to the Tennis match on ESPN2. The minute the man is over, we'll be back on the deuce."
"<at>coochaveli Thank You, Sir!"
"<at>cali0124 I am doing no such thing. Simply pointing out that they're injured!"
"<at>GARYSLISTENING Tonight I believe the will. Rest of series will be highly competitive."
"Hope y'all enjoyed 1st Take today. About to come on Sportscenter RIGHT NOW!!!"
"Happy Birthday to you son bro, <at>DwyaneWade. All the best to you and your family!"
"<at>Tony_Tooon I say 4 Games."
"<at>futureRT_tobi I'm starting to think that way."
"I'm about to come on Sportscenter right now. Talking Heat/Celtics. Warming up for <at>RealSkipBayless on FIRST TAKE tomorrow morning!"
"<at>ECandelari05 Only because of injury. Nothing else!"
"<at>HuntPiece27 Ummmm, but I do. Listen, learn and deal with it."
"It's a 2-hour show, <at>HarlemNash. What's sad is your lack of appreciation for our willingness to be honest and delve into issues."
"Thank you, <at>NBsAceBoogy <at>stephenasmith"
"Reach out to me again, <at>TheBnchwarmer when you know what the hell you're talking about."
"My segment wasn't even about the game, <at>Eroc77. It was about a side issue that's been going on with officiating. Grow up. Listen!"
"Can't wait for 1st Take tomorrow. Anxious to see what <at>RealSkipBayless has to say about LeBron, the Celts, the officials. Check y'all in AM."
"1st Take coming at you right now!!!"
"<at>DVNine2xo I'd win for you, too :-)"
"<at>SakPaseOneLove It's necessary."
"<at>stlkbigdavid You're welcome."
"<at>DanTheCannon Ridiculous. Not even entertaining this discussion."
"<at>harryjunior1000 Grow up and take off your Pom Poms."
"<at>Vasuperstar34 Amen!"

"<at>iBreatheUF Keep listening. Keep learning."
"<at>TGlas05 thank you."
"<at>Austieepowell <at>paulwodarczyk Let him know."
"<at>Ludwig_van_1904 That he was Fat? Yes. And I meant every word of it because he was."
"<at>louielou7 Thank God you said that."
"<at>amendoza99b <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>RealSkipBayless Not even close. LeBron is a league MVP. Tebow's a BACKUP QUARTERBACK."
"<at>ldigyadig I'm a non-violent dude. Would not have happened. Plus, Bruce Bowen will kick my butt!"
"<at>louielou7 Say what you want about him, but there's no arguing that."
"<at>DatBoiBlackice <at>Supaman404 Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa."
"<at>GibSoColdPS3 And he sells. YOu should see the numbers developed when he's talked about or makes appearances. Damn Shame!"
"<at>NicholasDOnza How 'bout that."
"<at>diamonds2323 <at>RyanRuocco I think it's a little more than that."
"<at>MJCB_Junky <at>SmoovArt I talked about what he looked like. I never once said Sammy Sosa had a disease."
"<at>MackDian Always."
"<at>jestrellaHEAT Thank you so much!"
"<at>DribblePasShoot Sorry. You're stuck with me for the next 4 Years!"
"<at>StanThe_Man11 Always will be!"
"<at>RipBoy01 Thanks Bro!"
"Spurs' passing is just unreal right now, and Tony Parker is putting on a clinic. OKC has better be ready when they get back home."
"I have no idea what ridiculousness is about to come out of <at>RealSkipBayless mouth this morning on FIRST TAKE. But I'm ready. Buckle up! 10am"
"We started FIRST TAKE on ESPNews due to the French Open. We are now on ESPN2."
"<at>BigJD1701 Doesn't mean I said the Miami Heat would get swept!"
"Damn! Damn! Damn! <at>RealSkipBayless is gonna have a field day tomorrow after LBJ missed that last shot. 1st Take will be on ESPNews tomorrow"
"<at>JimmyLaRocca Thank You!"
"<at>JeevPhoenixKing Goodbye!"
"<at>harrolld Would love to be on SNL. Waiting for them to ask me to HOST it!"
"<at>harryjunior1000 Sir, you are confusing me with <at>RealSkipBayless!"
"<at>AaronMckee1987 Nope! We had to wait entire careers to get to this point. Why should someone else get a pass? Pay your dues!"
"<at>JoeyLozito Liar! America will never be ready for 2 Brothers like us......TOGETHER!"
"<at>DubbsWilliams25 Me to!"
"Yo Y'all. I think SNL's Jay Pharoah may bless FIRST TAKE with his presence next week. Hope he does. Would absolutely Freakin Love it!!!"
"Unlike <at>RealSkipBayless I recognize that nothing's over with these Spurs. I picked OKC to win this game, but it'll still get interesting"
"About to come on Sportscenter RIGHT NOW for a few minutes before tussling with <at>RealSkipBayless on 1st Take this morning on ESPNews. FYI..."
"The Stephen A. Smith/Ryan Ruocco Show is coming at you on 98.7FM on ESPN NY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!"
"<at>Aaron_Coleman_ Thank You!"
"<at>YoungWojYaHeard Stop being ignorant. I hold LBJ accountable for a title. THAT'S ALL! What else does he need prove?"
"<at>SundyBear Doesn't apply to those dudes. Trust me!"
"<at>Blessit2009 true!"
"Haaaaa!!!!!!!!!! What up, Big Boy! Always good to hear from you, Bro!"
"<at>Vanglorious34 thank you for reminding me of this!"
"<at>LiveFree_NdLove Boston. Strictly an emotional decision. Honestly don't know what they have left after losing Game 2 that way."
"<at>Rautavaara goodbye. Nice knowing you."
"<at>CodyeDaniel24 Nobody's nearly as bad as Tebow. Not even close."
"<at>Dj_16diamond Thank you."
"<at>Simply_Mikeyyy He'll always have an invitation on 1st Take. But I don't believe he'll ever use it so long as Skip is there."
"<at>TheRealJGeller Eventually, Yes!"
"<at>tjjoyner2000 Yes."
"<at>kingkong217 They just did a month ago. I'm ALL GOOD, BRO. But I do appreciate the love. Thank You."
"<at>DeonHumphrey88 Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa."
"<at>WavyAmmar Never once did I call him clutch. I said it doesn't matter if he's clutch because he has D-Wade!"
"<at>Joey80000 haaaaa! Cute!"
"<at>Ro29061 He'll beat Manny! Mark my words!"
"<at>Johnathan32 <at>stephenasmith I like them in Game 4, Spurs in Game 5. Haven't decided on Game 6 yet."
"<at>Krueger_x360a <at>RealSkipBayless <at>stephenasmith I'll be on Sportscenter all day long from OKC."
"<at>mynorImartinez <at>stephenasmith I've never seen THEM play defense like that before. Listen, and you'd know. Stop Hatin just to Hate!"
"<at>ErinMay_ <at>stephenasmith Where were you when I picked them to win Game 6? Where you conveniently deaf?"
"<at>emeh68 <at>stephenasmith Ppl like you get on my damn nerves. You're never around when you wrong. But always front and center other times."
"It is bananas down here in OKC -- my first time in this place. And SA's suddenly looking old isn't gonna quiet these folks down one bit."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, if Duncan continues to struggle, San Antonio is not winning this series! Btw, Ginobli and Parker are looking avg, too."
"Umm, in case no one has noticed, SERGE IBAKA AND KENDRICK PERKINS have combined for 23 points already -- and it's not even halftime! Trouble"
"Gotta watch the rest of this game and see if San Antonio has just hit a wall! They suddenly look old, tired and immobile. Let's see."
"What a game. But officials helping OKC on a couple of bogus calls."
"Tony Parker is special!"
"Big-Time three by Harden with 9:08 left. Stymied SA's momentum a bit. But this game isn't over yet!"
"OKC has to be careful now. Everyone's making shots for SA Now. Parker, Neal, Diaw. Scoring won't be enough. They've got to get stops!"
"Kevin Durant is a Closer! This is why folks say he's everything LBJ is not. It's what he's doing in the 4th QT. Popovich is looking for ans."
"Can't find it!"
"About to come on Sportscenter RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>houston_molinar Never once said anything about color of skin. Does someone pay you to lie for a living or do you just do it for attention?"
"<at>sooner4life82 Wonderful, on both fronts!"
"<at>LymonParty I believe LeBron is the best all-around player in the world. I also believe it won't mean a thing until he closes -- and wins."
"This is unbelievable and sad all in the same breath! Miami is being exposed to some degree, and we're left to fantasize: what if Celts......"
"......Were completely healthy. Pierce, Allen and Avery Bradley!"
"About to do SPORTSCENTER right now before heading over to do 1st Take on ESPNews (until it switches to ESPN2). <at>RealSkipBayless is TICKED!!!"
"FIRST TAKE is coming on ESPN2 Following the Tennis Match!"
"Thank you so much, <at>Ash_noelle <at>stephenasmith. Really appreciate it."
"Ask me a question and I'll give you as honest an answer as I possibly can,  <at>aundy_s <at>stephenasmith. No agendas. I say what I mean!"
"Watch your damn mouth :-) <at>AdamSnider14 <at>stephenasmith"
"<at>rashadalaiyan <at>stephenasmith Everything. Been watching it for 36 years -- and counting."
"Thank you so much, <at>BigBooty_Lucy23. And btw....love the twitter name."
"<at>TH3g0oS3 <at>espn Because you can't help but watch."
"<at>NORKALGOLLO KD in the 4th QT."
"It'll be a struggle, <at>SliverV2 <at>RealSkipBayless <at>KingJames, but I think he'll do it. He'll have no choice. I've done it!"
"<at>2BusyFuggin <at>stephenasmith Very good thing!"
"<at>E_BeEasy <at>stephenasmith Thanks bro!"
"<at>dmsingh09 Loved it. Seriously!"
"<at>SERG1O_D Love it."
"<at>ChaseLedbetter Heat bench and D-Wade."
"<at>kavbosh You couldn't give Stats away for a box of cookies. He's not healthy, owed $62-million and UNinsured."
"<at>JeffMuth It's all about the specific questions that are asked for me."
"<at>JudahKrav actually I didn't forget to mention that. Perhaps if you pulled the wax out of your ears you would've heard that point!"
"When crunch time arrives, when palms get sweaty, certain people step up…"" -<at>stephenasmith on <at>KDTrey5 » http://t.co/VVbzWqLL "
"<at>dwalsh4 They would be down by 30"
"It's over. KD and the crew are heading back to OKC to close out the Spurs. Can't see it any other way. Props to Jalen and Tim Legler"
"<at>Im_Me_soBeYou <at>coachdavemiller <at>RealSkipBayless <at>stephenasmith Certainly doesn't look that way now."
"<at>rlandrewramirez <at>stephenasmith It will be on ESPNews."
"<at>Dswilling <at>stephenasmith <at>ESPN_FirstTake When you're wrong bro, you're wrong. I'm man enough to admit it."
"<at>marzblkman <at>stephenasmith Amen"
"<at>MariusSose <at>stephenasmith When you're right, you're right."
"The Great Jay Pharaoh of SNL is about to be on LIVE on FIRST TAKE. Don't miss it!"
"<at>kwamkam You were correct!"
"<at>nacho0322 I disagreed with him!"
"<at>BigDank350 Stop it!"
"<at>Eslonkosky I said they look better. Miami has got to step up!"
"<at>KillaQuis1 Thanks Bro!"
"<at>ebrezina29 EXACTLY! Right now....not when D-Wade is on his game. Thank you for quoting me accurately!"
"<at>OH_forREAL I said they look better right now w/ the way they're playing. D-Wade and the crew MUST play better!"
"<at>iam_ADHD I thought their health would doom them. If they were healthy I would've picked them!"
"<at>Canekid11 Damn! :-)"
"<at>Clayton793 don't want it right now. Happy doing 1st Take and Sportscenter. It's all I need right now."
"<at>tcoyne91 yes! But I'm still picking Miami."
"<at>shaneyboy16 You're such a wuss. Where were you when I picked them to win the 1st 2 series? Or Games 3-and-4?"
"I'm about to be on Sportscenter right now. Then after that, I'll go all-in on <at>RealSkipBayless on the Heat. May be best 1ST TAKE EVER!"
"FIRST TAKE is on ESPNews Today.......NOT ESPN2."
"Check out this link: http://t.co/2IoIFxkx."
"<at>Josh_Marino We're on ESPNews right now!"
"<at>wbconservative Damn! That hurts to hear anyone say that!"
"<at>MjTs23 Fair is a place where they judge pigs!"
"<at>I_XIII_MCMXCII Thank you sir!"
"<at>MarathonGary Never on NHL. Don't have the slightest clue."
"<at>AnthonysOpinion Thank You!"
"<at>jsmith2268 We do. We're friends. Just have absolutely nothing in common!"
"<at>MoeDiddy316 told ya'll I'm not tolerating that language. Goodbye!"
"<at>AliShaheedMo language. Goodbye bro. You're officially blocked!"
"I'm on ESPN NY (98.7FM) with my man <at>RyanRuocco from 1-3pm. In other words....RIGHT NOW!!!"
"<at>hammt34 thank you!"
"<at>doriandelph thank you!"
"<at>jbird010 CLEARLY you didn't watch FIRST TAKE. I said the Celts WON the game. 2 hours is better than 4 min. Watch the show on ESPN2 in AM."
"<at>GMENBANKS830 actually, I'm not always yelling. I've been quite cool for a vast majority of this show. It's just easier for you to fib!"
"<at>REAL_RONMEXICO My tune has not changed. He just didn't do a good job last night. But I still believe in him long term!"
"Yeah, I said it, <at>Derek_6_Duque. Nobody's hiding. Everyone knows I WANT Miami to win. I just don't BELIEVE it anymore."
"<at>Shlick88 <at>LegsESPN <at>TheHerd Sincerely doubt Phil would work for Riles."
"<at>Vibegirl <at>KingJames <at>DwyaneWade Agreed."
"<at>CityOfChampion2 Tell me about it."
"<at>youngmade26 :-). I aim to please."
"<at>DenizcanSrc Stop!"
"I'm about to go on Sportscenter at the top of the 6 o'clock hour. Looking for OKC to close the show tonight. Same for the Celts tomorrow."
"Wouldn't mind both teams losing Game 6 -- although I'd love to see an OKC/Miami Finals -- but I just can't see it happening. Disappointing."
"And after much thought, Tivo watching and going IN on D-Wade, I went back and watched Game 5. Don't get what D-Wade says, he's HURT. Knee!"
"There is no way he's losing it in the first half, but not in the 4th QT. He's pacing himself. He's got to go ALL OUT right now. No Tomorrow!"
"As for OKC, Harden's a star. Westbrook's a star. And Durant is whatever the hell he wants to be. Mad respect 2 SA, but I'm a believer in KD."
"I don't know how anybody else feels, but this game is just special. Just special. And MAJOR PROPS to Stephen Jackson. Boy Showed up!!!"
"Speaking of Jackson, that Tech called against him was straight BOGUS. This is why the officiating needs to be addressed."
"Durant is so so Special."
"Stephen Jackson said: ""If you scared, go to church."" Clearly, he's not scared!"
"Special, <at>reggie_bush. This is just something special to see."
"Now Durant is drawing off. Fouls.  Amazing. Btw.......Westbrook has to stop. He's starving so much to be involved offensively, he's F**** up"
"Messin up, that is! Don't want to imply that I'm cussing on Twitter :-)"
"This is just great to see. My man BT is absolutely correct: Greatness Blossoming. And KD did it the right way. Just special!"
"Oh stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless. This game wasn't lost by SA. It was won by Durant and OKC. Special moment. Don't rain on it!"
"OKC handled it's business. Now let's see who'll do it b/t Miami and Boston. FIRST TAKE is coming at you right now. ESPNews (10-to-Noon)."
"The re-air to FIRST TAKE will be on after the tennis match on ESPN2."
"I have no comment. I'm not in the business of critiquing my colleagues. None of us should be."
"<at>BostonFan97H8 I actually like Boston. Just not better than South Beach :-)"
"<at>LukaLadan What conflict!"
"<at>NY3D I picked Boston to win Game 6!"
"<at>jvdenny It's playful. Skip gets it. Most folks do."
"<at>Snikk1efritz Not True!"
"<at>ImRyanMcGuire <at>ESPNNY98_7FM <at>stephenasmith <at>RyanRuocco <at>Chris_Broussard We're on 1-3pm every weekday."
"Just FYI.....my show with Ryan Ruocco is on right now. We're on the air every weekday from 1-3pm EST on the all new ESPN NY (98.7FM)"
"<at>MRPROVIDENCE I picked Miami to win the series. I believe I was wrong. But my feelings about KG has always been consistent. Always will be."
"<at>The_JarredIvory <at>stephenasmith Glad you know it. Because I always will."
"<at>JMichaels_ <at>stephenasmith Thanks Bro!"
"<at>SherekaJones <at>stephenasmith I'll be there babygirl!"
"<at>LarryTark87 Happy Birthday, bro. Wishing you many, many more healthy ones."
"<at>ACMuzik Yes Sir"
"<at>haitihba Thank you for supporting me. very much appreciated."
"<at>trusu305 Stop it! You're not robbed when you surrender an 18-point lead inside of 12 minutes."
"<at>Saywhatdude420 And so is your stupidity and bias. They lost. Surrendered an 18-point lead inside of 12 minutes. Get over it."
"<at>Michael_112278 We were talking sports, bro. Not politics. But I hear your point. Some balance would be appreciated."
"<at>Ova_DaTop Thank you."
"<at>JeromeCtheOne <at>KingJames The time for talk is over. These brothers know what time it is. They're either going to do it or not."
"<at>YOUNG_WROBERT Most of the time,......yes!"
"<at>clubalane You're exaggerating on that one. Absolutely no need to bring up race with something so innocuous."
"AMERICA, y'all can say what you want but this is some SPECTACULAR stuff we're seeing from LeBron. SPECTACULAR. Can't say a word right now!!!"
"8:36 left in 3rd. Boston pulls w/in 60-48. Miami TO! LeBron is screaming at coaches to get him the ball as he walks to bench. Damn Right!"
"<at>onome222 Thank you."
"Stephen A. and Ryan Ruocco on the All New ESPN-NY (98.7FM) is on right now. Talking LeBron, Heat/Celts, Mets/Yankees and more. Buckle Up"
"<at>FloridaMan305 Amen, bro! That's why I showed up in Boston last night. When you're wrong, you're wrong."
"<at>Ovrly_Dedicated You wish!"
"<at>TheStevenBerger <at>CharlizeAfrica Haaaa. I AM a big-time Charlize Theron fan, though."
"Look, nobody has been more critical of LBJ's need to finally capture an NBA Championship, but I can't believe all the hatin'."
"Compare LBJ's performance to anyone, and maybe Jordan's 63-pt display -- or Magic's 42-and-15 in the Finals -- or..........."
"......Jordan's 35 in the 1st half of Game 2 in the Finals vs. Portland and Clyde Drexler. But that's about it."
"Haaaaaaa, <at>fbluke <at>WhitlockJason. I hear your points. I get it."
"<at>DianteAshby Thank ya boss."
"<at>BriTToCT Love ya back!"
"That is not true. My thoughts were much more complete than that, <at>AthleteLifeee <at>KingJames. Twitter annoys me sometimes just b/c of peeps..."
"like you, <at>AthleteLifeee <at>KingJames. Hate all you want. Just quote me accurately, completely and in context."
"There's still a Game 7 to play, <at>onome222. and <at>KingJames has to finish. Even if it requires help, he has to finish."
"That's the absolute truth, <at>Sarcasm24Seven <at>Victoria27NYC. Most of the NBA do feel Miami is HOLLYWOOD AS HELL. But they respect it."
"Thank you so, so much, <at>onome222 <at>stephenasmith"
"Thank you, <at>mfilisky <at>stephenasmith <at>RealSkipBayless"
"Absolutely, <at>JYanish <at>stephenasmith"
"Keys to 2nite's Game for Miami: D-Wade has GOT to show up early. Can't leave it to LeBron to carry the Heat. Gotta avg more than 5.8 a half."
"For Boston: KG has to get off early. Plus, Doc doesn't need to put Pierce on LBJ if he wants Pierce to deliver buckets."
"I've never seen anything like this is all my years covering the NBA. 1 minute, dudes look like they want to play; another, lost!"
"I know find myself more interested in seeing who'll make a better series for OKC than who'll win Game 7. Pretty damn sad."
"I've got Pacman, <at>skrappack209. I think Bradley's entirely too excited/ antsy, had minimal punching power and is moving up in lbs."
"<at>DonCray78 Then why don't you disappear from my page and follow someone who does?"
"<at>Zac_Nicholson I love'em because I picked them to win Game 7, believing they wouldn't lose 2 games at home in this series? Grow up!"
"I wouldn't accuse Paul Pierce of flopping, <at>VinnyMays2424 <at>RyanRuocco. He's many things. And a baller is one of them."
"Thank you for acknowledging that, <at>KidTakeOff. That's exactly what I will always do because that is who I am. Always!!!"
"It should, <at>JTsteez <at>RyanRuocco"
"Not offended at all, <at>giantsfan719. Although it's not true I can certainly admit it appears that way. I'm good with the criticism."
"Not true, <at>Blessit2009 <at>RyanRuocco"
"If you're rooting for the Miami Heat, here's what should concern you: Rondo 10 Assists, zero TO's. Both Pierce and Allen are"
"shooting 50% or better. And the Celtics are still up 7 after KG had to go to the bench with 6:50 left after picking up his 3rd foul. Uh Oh!"
"And btw...in case no one has noticed, Ray Allen's stroke is looking very, very sweet. The Heat look lethargic, disinterested. Very Bad!"
"No matter what's happening in this game, remember Miami's supporting cast flows with the tempo LeBron and D-Wade set."
"LeBron and D-Wade have got to do something. They just can't leave it to Battier and Chalmers to try and drain 3's. In fact, I think"
"I think Spoelstra needs to put in Norris Cole. Just someone to push the ball up the floor and provide ENERGY. Miami just looks dry."
"I don't care that D-Wade just hit that jumper. I'm watching Heat' players bumping into 1-another, tripping, etc. What the Hell?"
"However, now that it's tied up, let's see what they'll do with things from here. Talk to y'all later."
"I'm en route to OKC and I can't wait until for the NBA Finals. LeBron vs. Durant. D-Wade vs. Westbrook and Harden. Lovin' it"
"Honestly, though, I'm proud of <at>KingJames. He's balled. But there's no way around it: He still has to finish. If Durant wins...."
"Where will LeBron go from here? While we question if Miami will get better, we KNOW KD and OKC will. The road only gets harder for Miami."
"Oh, BTW.....haven't had a chance to see Bradley/Pacquaio yet. If it's robbery like folks say, something needs to be done w/ Boxing!"
"I am so sick and damn tired of these bogus decisions. Let UFC's Dana White take over and just start giving folks fights we want 2 C."
"Nothing secret about it, <at>evancraig1. I'd love for <at>KingJames to win it all. Just don't believe it's happening vs. KD and OKC."
"D-Wade never had Westbrook's speed, <at>madhwn. And Westbrook doesn't have D-Wade's poise, gears and b-ball IQ."
"Can you kiss off or go to someone else's twitter page and tell them what to do, <at>104stang???"
"I'd pick me for the George Jefferson role, <at>TheEdfromVegas <at>leecrowe <at>hosienation. Especially w/ the Funky Chicken :-)"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, deal with this dude, <at>nikko_gosohard, please. These are the kind of peeps we all need to collectively address."
"Yes Sir, I do, <at>akaDaLo <at>KingJames <at>DwyaneWade <at>MiamiHEAT. I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it."
"Forgot to reach out to you and say thanks for that interview, <at>Wale. Enjoyed it, bro. See you down the line!"
"A moment to send my condolences to my boy, <at>NYJayBee, as die-hard as a Mets' fan as I know. Swept by my Yankees AGAIN! So sorry!"
"Hoping to see you in OKC, <at>LilTunechi. If there's anything I can do for you, I happily will."
"All I know, <at>TheRealMikeEpps, is that you don't need to be talking about my hairline more like you did in Dallas :-) Much love, bruh!"
"Just giving credit where credit is due, <at>Patches_MC"
"Can't wait to see it, <at>wale. Looking forward to it!"
"Yours truly and <at>RealSkipBayless LIVE from Oklahoma City for FIRST TAKE ALL WEEK LONG. Do I need to say anymore!!!!!!!!! Buckle Up!!!!"
"Then it is his fault because he SHOULD know better by now, <at>OGPerryIV"
"Sadly! <at>pussyandpills <at>RealSkipBayless"
"I'm never scripted, <at>nickFOOSKYmillz. And just because I say something you don't want to hear doesn't make me wrong. Ever!"
"<at>KCKINGSTONBA Possibly."
"I'm about to tell you right here on FIRST TAKE, <at>BMW_OVO"
"<at>JMichaels_ Yes!"
"<at>HeatFan05 Thanks my man."
"<at>HeatFan05 Thank you dear."
"Haaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,<at>BallinLikeA_MF <at>RealSkipBayless"
"Amen! <at>THEdancarr <at>RealSkipBayless"
"<at>Tsizzle66 <at>stephenasmith You're welcome."
"<at>chase167 <at>stephenasmith 27"
"He needs prayer :-)<at>DarrenSutton86 <at>RealSkipBayless"
"Thanks, bro! <at>VegaHeat6 <at>RealSkipBayless"
"I DO believe it, <at>BtEarls_33. That's the only reason I picked OKC. I never root vs. <at>DwyaneWade. But I truly believe OKC is better"
"Thank you, <at>HopOffKeDrICK"
"Yes, it should, <at>getmunneyslam00. Welcome aboard."
"<at>king21luis I don't miss points on B-Ball, bro. I know exactly what I said."
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, <at>DDJMat. That's hilarious."
"<at>cah630 <at>stephenasmith Thank You!"
"Actually, I don't feel like I'm overboard at all, <at>LBJFanInNYC. I meant every word I said."
"Yep! <at>VegasSilk. And I still don't believe it will be enough to beat OKC."
"Don't blame <at>HBO or any network for the state of Boxing, <at>JmartinezLTF. It's not anyone else's fault. Boxing can't do this."
"They can't continue to get away with hoodwinking us, <at>JmartinezLTF. Give us the fights we want to see and be fair. Not too much to ask."
"No dynasties until they win a chip, <at>LGFrisbeeguy"
"<at>MattSapaula Thanks Bro!"
"FIRST TAKE coming at you right now...LIVE from Oklahoma City. And <at>RealSkipBayless is in the house. Won't help him today, though. ESPN2! Haa"
"<at>Chadthegunner you do!"
"<at>412Hazie We'll see!"
"<at>DennisKadett Epic!"
"<at>kopack83 nope!"
"<at>JLapi Hell Yes. My last name ain't Kardashian. I need all the cushion I can get."
"<at>bopitts6 Have a nice life. Told you about the language!"
"<at>alloydesq I heard about you loss. I'm so so sorry. Please let me know if there's anything I can do!"
"<at>West_51k Just having fun, bro. Calm down!"
"<at>CoachMicah Ignorant dudes like you would say such a thing. Zero merit. But why bother!"
"You can always listen to me, Girl, <at>KSBeautifulMess <at>NYJTimmck <at>espn <at>ESPNNewYork. I won't let you down :-)"
"I've picked OKC in 6, <at>AndrewBuzzzz"
"We'll see, <at>INEmgCEO"
"Who knows, <at>Jonwithoutthe_H. I may already be on the game without even knowing it."
"Both, sincerely, <at>ColtDaddy69"
"What do you mean ""EVEN"" <at>juggathaMOTM. Watch your mouth."
"I'm picking OKC in 6, <at>MrDaddysGirls24. If that's your definition of NO CHANCE, so be it."
"Serge Ibaka, <at>AlexCivitano"
"So you slept on a brother, <at>Unfiltered_BS. Appreciate you manning up and admitting it."
"Pul-leeze <at>Frankiieeee_"
"who cares? <at>ll_c0ol_Dre"
"It's a very big deal, <at>LoveElLay. It'll only be that much harder for <at>KingJames if he doesn't get it done now."
"oooooohhhhhhh, <at>MinkaKen. That's a good one."
"Tell'em you love me, Girl! <at>liahLS <at>stephenasmith"
"Odds are slim for Miami, <at>BIGCROY <at>stephenasmith <at>KingJames <at>DwyaneWade. I'm just being real about it. Hope I'm wrong, but doubt it."
"Pick it now, girl! <at>KIARAorCHRISSY <at>stephenasmith. You want a brother to AGREE with you OR KEEP IT REAL WITH YOU? Pick it!!!"
"Not fair, <at>ShazamW0W. <at>DwyaneWade did not say it like that. You're misrepresenting his words."
"Problem?<at>VSholokhova <at>rel_e12 <at>stephenasmith"
"Is it that? <at>rjtrules. Or were you just rude in your approach to folks and got checked?....<at>ShazamW0W <at>DwyaneWade"
"Vital, <at>WhoButJosh <at>stephenasmith. Derek Fisher will need to provide stability in moments where they'll need to keep their poise."
"I can't imagine the Heat winning 3-straight games in this series, <at>Sma5h_n_Thra5H <at>stephenasmith <at>juggathaMOTM"
"I try, <at>ChevyFlow <at>stephenasmith"
"<at>mattyice1131 <at>stephenasmith Thank you."
"I feel you, <at>bird031 <at>stephenasmith <at>ESPN_FirstTake"
"Somebody has to, <at>aries_327 <at>stephenasmith"
"Without question......we'll give Durant his due, <at>melyssa23 <at>stephenasmith <at>KDTrey5 <at>KingJames. It's not like we'd have a choice"
"I hope <at>KingJames wins, <at>TheErikFox. I truly do! But I don't see it happening in this series. OKC is just too potent... <at>stephenasmith"
"Listen more, you'll agree more,<at>impaktDIGGS <at>stephenasmith"
"Actually, not true, <at>HaffLauren <at>stephenasmith. Just the conference finals. But you're right: That's bad enough."
"Durant, <at>tluddy24 <at>stephenasmith"
"<at>Coopa_Troopa12 <at>stephenasmith Yes!"
"True Dat (haaaaaa!!!!!!!) <at>SlimkidTDB <at>Sma5h_n_Thra5H <at>juggathaMOTM"
"Agreed (Haaaaaaa!!!!!!!) <at>GlaysonLeroy <at>stephenasmith"
"Not true, <at>MikecomX <at>stephenasmith <at>AndrewBuzzzz"
"Thank you so much, <at>mchassares <at>stephenasmith"
"Thank you, sir (Haaaaa!!!!!) <at>Frank_IRL <at>stephenasmith"
"No way they'd be able to get both, <at>InFamousFav <at>stephenasmith"
"Not true. <at>KingRich260 <at>stephenasmith"
"ON THE COURT, <at>CjGazerro <at>stephenasmith. As game is in progress."
"Get over it, <at>ConnorBowen13 <at>stephenasmith. My prediction doesn't change what Miami's going to do. I'm not playing; they are."
"Quite Possible.<at>TChinakwe <at>stephenasmith"
"No sir! <at>MellRoy_Jetson <at>stephenasmith"
"No he is not, <at>THEDOCOFTHEDAWN <at>RyanRuocco <at>stephenasmith <at>KingJames. But that doesn't mean he doesn't need to be."
"Clearly, you do NOT like me, <at>jassi2354 <at>stephenasmith"
"<at>CoachMicah sorry bruh! I'm where I'm at and you're where you are. Deal with it. Be Happy!"
"<at>AundrayJackson We'll see!"
"<at>alloydesq Moms, too??? I had no idea!"
"What the hell do you mean you don't know <at>Shaq. Are you watching this? Durant is PURE! Ice! Money!"
"I think I pulled off a first, folks. On Sportscenter tonight with Skip, I think I called the Final Score EXACTLY!!!!!!"
"Uh Oh! <at>RealSkipBayless is at it again. FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 is coming at you RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Trippy??????????????<at>mannRUready"
"<at>JonZonBOi haven't played ball in 3 years. Pathetic. Gotta get back on the court!"
"<at>Adversariesbook Not me, Bruh!"
"<at>todd_nagy I do my best!!!!!!!!"
"In case y'all didn't seen this spoof on <at>RealSkipBayless, here ya go"
"Totally untrue, <at>LymonParty <at>SASBMJ <at>RealSkipBayless <at>stephenasmith"
"Obviously that's true, <at>gregkeown23. The facts state as much. The question was: is it fair or foul. And it's FOUL, <at>stephenasmith"
"D-Wade has shown up, but he needs to do more, <at>2JSilv8990 <at>SASBMJ <at>RealSkipBayless <at>DwyaneWade. What he's doing won't be enough!"
"I've said that to Skip on many occasions, <at>mstover311 <at>RealSkipBayless. But we're talking about Skip here. No hope!"
"This is the son of Michael Jordan????<at>Hater_ThatsMe <at>SASBMJ"
"Huh? What? Seriously? <at>pghazal <at>LilTunechi. Lil' Wayne looked cool to me sitting courtside."
"I agree, but a lot of it is legitimate, <at>Becks_Official. How do you know defend Durant in the 4th QT last night"
"Haaaaaa. Thank you my dear <at>DebCarson. Miss ya much. Hope you're well. And pls say hello to my boy <at>JimRome."
"I'm 17 years older,<at>JoshSmi95899949"
"Done already, <at>JstylezMrParker"
"<at>umee1989 I hear ya."
"That's because you didn't pay attention to the content, <at>ecnplay <at>RyanRuocco. Some flies caught with honey. Always remember that."
"Because that's the way the world works, <at>Suus_Brittannia <at>JoshSmi95899949"
"No reason to be testy without facts, <at>bshreffler81 <at>jimrome. Can't get any commissioner based on conjecture, innuendo or perceptions."
"Thanks bro, <at>Coach2Win_Mike"
"Thanks bro, <at>PeteyPablo2030"
"Feel Free, <at>TheRealAWarsame"
"He would need to, <at>umee1989. I'm rooting <at>KingJames. I DO NOT want him to fail. But he's got to do it and <at>DwyaneWade must help him."
"Hell no, but since when has to truth mattered with these haters, <at>_AJDavid"
"I'm shutting it down, <at>kennyjoseph5"
"That's B.S., <at>Apbestever. We always have passion. No need to hate to have it. It's called being a grown up. Take notes! Learn!"
"My bad, <at>Adam_Jeffrey. Hope you're well. Thanks for the tweet. <at>stephenasmith"
"Ab-so-freakin-lutely, <at>Whitestkidalive <at>stephenasmith"
"Nope, <at>MrSUJag_1526. <at>KingJames just needs to win. And at this point, so does <at>DwyaneWade. <at>stephenasmith"
"You must be on drugs, <at>JJBas808 <at>stephenasmith"
"If......If.........If, <at>vermesmike <at>stephenasmith"
"A younger version (haaaaaaaaaaa), <at>MikeyPhatz <at>stephenasmith"
"Agreed, <at>KinnyKinn <at>stephenasmith <at>DwyaneWade <at>KingJames. But they can get better. They just need to."
"Yes it, <at>RealSkipBayless. No argument here."
"No Comment! I get along with both, <at>NYMurdock"
"For those of you who didn't see this commercial spoof of <at>RealSkipBayless, check it out: http://t.co/LHXOg493."
"I did ask, <at>KB_Mamba <at>stephenasmith"
"Hope ya'll are watching <at>realskipbayless on FIRST TAKE. He's crazy."
"I try, bro! <at>KingofKings214 <at>stephenasmith. I try."
"An explosion from LeBron AND D-Wade, <at>kdiddyO79. And lots of prayer."
"Jim Rome is a friend, <at>marcattack. Don't include me in your insults. <at>stephenasmith <at>jimrome"
"A Healthy D-Rose, <at>KingofKings214 <at>stephenasmith."

"<at>LukeMishu at least I respond to you!"
"Amen! <at>MadDogRadio"
"<at>jamila_phillips Why are we posing on Twitter???"
"Haaaaaaaaaaa, <at>tsepter73"
"Haaaaa. Yes Sir, <at>GMENBANKS830"
"Hope y'all are tuning into me and my boy, <at>RyanRuocco, on ESPN New York (98.7FM). We're on from 1-3 pm every weekday."
"<at>D_Hill80 No sir! Finished my LA Show 6 weeks ago. Only Radio Show is on ESPN NY."
"<at>teedoyle21 Thanks Bro!"
"<at>NOTyo_uncleTHO Who cares?"
"<at>TrashinEveryone Explain?"
"<at>3DonDeck :-):-)"
"<at>cjt0805 stop it! You know better."
"<at>Suits_Suck_84 Already did that!"
"Those are the same folks who'd complain about peeps not being real enough, <at>BTroyXXL. Tell'em to appreciate honesty. Stop Whining!"
"<at>VegasPapa I don't believe T.O. Is washed up. I want him to do well. Just want him to stop telling folks his personal business."
"<at>candygirl317 :-) Thank you!"
"You're not worth the time, <at>cjt0805"
"Sorry! Calling in 2 Hours bro!"
"Unbelievable, <at>wolfman_13 <at>RyanRuocco. And it influences the players to think the same. Go figure!"
"I'm brilliant, bruh, because I KNOW I'M NOT. I learn from others, <at>cjt0805. U R too much of a hater to notice I always say that."
"Thanks, bro! <at>DeeskiLBM10"
"Truth be told, I don't think <at>HEAT will ever trade <at>Dwyane Wade, <at>DeAndre_pete. And neither would I. Just don't think they win NOW!"
"But I truly do believe <at>DwyaneWade will come back next year stronger than ever, <at>DeAndre_pete. He's that kind of competitor."
"I'm not always right, <at>vberardinelli1. Just most of the time."
"You should! <at>DishonWJohnson"
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, <at>FitnessPhanatic <at>stephenasmith <at>RealSkipBayless"
"I can't speak on what's going to happen in the 2nd Half. But Westbrook looks awful. Gotta get it together."
"I won't lie. I can't believe how awful Westbrook has played tonight. He's making <at>RealSkipBayless look like a straight-up prophet!!!"
"No doubt KD was fouled by <at>KingJames on that last play. But LBJ played his butt off. 12-for-12 FT's were huge, too. Give it up 2nite."
"As for OKC, two sickening pts: Thunder came in w/o urgency, like they had the damn game. And Westbrook was HORRIBLE! Zero Floor leadership!"
"Westbrook is 23. I believe in him and his skills. But he's GOT to play better. If OKC loses these Finals, it will be because of HIM."
"As for <at>DwyaneWade, he was better tonight. Like I said, he's warming up for Game 3, where he'll explode. But Miami MUST WIN 2-of-3.."
"IN MIAMI. They must go back to OKC up 3-2 to win the NBA Championship. Nothing less will get it done. Welcome to the NBA Finals, everyone."
"Goodnight. Don't forget to catch FIRST TAKE tomorrow morning. I'll try to make it easier for all of us to stomach <at>RealSkipBayless."
"Remember, <at>RealSkipBayless called Miami to win Game 2. He said it would NOT be because of <at>KingJames. But expect selective amnesia 2 kick in"
"Yeah! <at>RealSkipBayless and I got into it. B/t <at>KingJames, Westbrook and Lil' Wayne, what do y'all expect? FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 at top of hour"
"Stop smoking so early in the morning, <at>questions2_t3"
"Clearly, you don't watch the show, <at>CooperCooper1. It's not me you have to worry about!"
"I hear ya! <at>ChiCubFan08"
"Yes I do, <at>BtEarls_33"
"What's false?, <at>domiNATE_23 <at>JaredFielden"
"<at>SwaggerLikeBubs <at>espn Goodbye!"
"Nope! <at>ChrisBarnettII. Because Westbrook might really disappear after that."
"Stop it! <at>d_harrison92 <at>RealSkipBayless <at>stephenasmith <at>QU2_"
"Now ya know, <at>myman_mitch_ <at>ElTrillDj <at>stephenasmith"
"That was a funny one, <at>MsLaurenLondon. But there is no ""Martin"" better than him describing how he and Gina first me. Look it up!"
"Please trust me when I tell you this: Durant is NOT 6' 9"", <at>IbreatheMETS <at>stephenasmith <at>RyanRuocco"
"Keep your eyes on the NBA Finals, my man <at>jimmykimmel. Just because the Lakers aren't playing doesn't mean it won't be special."
"Enjoy your day in the sun, my man <at>iamsteveharvey. You got it today. Just don't go hiding next week if <at>KingJames loses."

"And you're an ignorant one for thinking that amounts to RACISM, <at>BC71295. Grow up! Somethings ain't about Black/White. Just YOU!"
"We're talking locale in regards to teams, <at>Yo_Q_Crush <at>stephenasmith <at>TheNBPA <at>basketballtalk"
"I think the Heat will win Game 3, <at>MirnessCurt <at>stephenasmith. I think it happens because <at>DwyaneWade explodes. He's due!"
"Sorry baby, <at>BEAUTYWins <at>stephenasmith. I'm already a very happy proud papa. Not looking for anything. But again -- Thank you!"
"Good luck, my brother, <at>_Ambitiouskid. Wishing you all the best. <at>stephenasmith"
"<at>Harty96 <at>stephenasmith No problem."

"<at>FrostTips Zero!"
"<at>MWBoJR Yeah! But he's not THE ROCK!"
"<at>Matt_Cole_08 His PG play was Horrible. But no one's blind. Westbrook is big-time and with get buckets. Needs to make better decisions."

"<at>Super_Villainn Just wish him the best. All-Star player and better person."
"<at>pkcorcoran Hhhaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"Thank you, <at>DavidOrozcoFSU <at>espn <at>RealSkipBayless"
"Not at all, <at>KevKevYazhari <at>PreachaJarvis33. LeBron has been sensational this series."
"It's not about justification, <at>KingVanPoww. It's about what has historically happened during the NBA Finals."
"It's a damn shame that I have to :-)<at>1AceOfSpades <at>K_Rob16 <at>RealSkipBayless"
"To some degree, <at>auslite. But he's a star. He can play better. And if he does, it's offer."
"It certainly would make me look good, <at>KINGDOMMALES. But here's the deal: OKC has to step up. If they don't, this will be over Thurs"
"Yeah, but I'm not looking good so far, <at>fearGRAYtness. I picked OKC to win this in 6 games. They may lose in 5 if they keep messing up."

"Personally, I would love to talk Baseball, <at>ejoballer24 <at>stephenasmith <at>RealSkipBayless. Wouldn't bother me one bit."
"I do, <at>REAL_RDON. But that doesn't mean I get to ignore what's taking place game-to-game."
"I have no problem with it, <at>tantode4181. Rondo is great but you have to have perimeter shooters when you're in Olympic play."

"Thank you my man, <at>Mike_Mamba <at>RealSkipBayless"
"Thank you very, very much for such kind words, <at>SciryLLyricS. Deeply appreciate it."
"Yes, <at>fernandoleer <at>LatinoHeat865 <at>RealMikeWilbon. We've always know that."
"Thanks, my man, <at>itsMrFYF"
"A lie, <at>SonOfTheBronx <at>dennis2_society. I don't bring it up. Others do. Stop lying."

"Okay, bro, <at>ChristianT_22. Keep pushing for your dreams."
"Yes, <at>kingotjungle. I'm exhausted :-)"
"FIRST TAKE! I just don't know what to do with <at>RealSkipBayless right now!"
"F<at>*#* Disgraceful! <at>BrandonTierney. Ridiculous."
"Christ means EVERYTHING to me, <at>ACOGChicago. Helps instill humility, diminishes frustration. Constant reminder of goal of higher purpose!"

"<at>Sante_Knox Then he should've spoken up earlier!"
"<at>cito456 Always!"

"<at>grullone We discussed Mets, as well!"
"<at>cito456 Thanks my man!"

"<at>dukesman2000 Thank You!"
"<at>asapxwill Thank You!"
"<at>WhiteCheddar11 The process! McGwire was given a pass."

"<at>Yung4ev3r Thanks my man!"
"<at>JMichaels_ Nope! It would be incredibly sad!"

"<at>6_INCH_STILETTO Dedication to my mom from time I was in college writing for school newspaper."
"Damn Shame! James Harden shriveling up before our very eyes. Durant not aggressive enough. Westbrook actually has to take over. Sad!"
"That's right Westbrook: TAKE OVER! He's the only one on OKC who really seems to want it. Everyone else is FOLDING!"
"Harden! What a sorry performance. Another missed shot. And Durant! You're down 3 with a minute left and you give it up to SEFOLOSHA! Oh Damn"
"Can't argue with you today, <at>IAmSteveHarvey. You're absolutely right. Still think OKC's the better team. But destiny is calling. LeBron!"
"It's over, <at>Twin990. Destiny is calling. You can always tell when things that shouldn't happen, keep happening. Just the way it works."
"Amen! <at>TarquiniusJ <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>MiamiHEAT <at>hatchetman83. No doubt about it."
"FIRST TAKE is coming at ya RIGHT NOW. And we know what that means: <at>RealSkipBayless on LeBron. And Westbrook. And Durant. Oh Lawd!!!"
"Thanks, bro, <at>KK_GAOFETOGE"
"Awful, <at>thatdudebender <at>ESPN_FirstTake"
"Not when it comes to <at>RealSkipBayless, <at>FlyBoOoyStacks <at>stephenasmith <at>ChrisBroussard. He criticizes LBJ so much, there's no room 4 us."
"Nope! Now stop with the ridiculous damn questions, <at>_BIGDEZ_ <at>stephenasmith <at>KingJames <at>RealSkipBayless"
"Sorry, <at>PortopongX1. I never attempt to talk Hockey :-)"
"Just FYI: <at>Chris_Broussard is absolutely correct. We were talking about LBJ. I honestly had no idea what it meant! Nothing more!"
"To all you Knicks' fans out there, what does LeBron winning a title do to the Knicks: http://t.co/8LiQ57dX"
"Here's the difference b/t me and <at>RealSkipBayless: I'm worried that LeBron is not 100 percent! Skip is predicting that ""he'll choke."" See?"
"FIRST TAKE coming at you at the top of the hour on ESPN2."
"Not true, <at>Dontral1. I call it like I see it. I'll criticize AND praise anyone according to what they do. Let's be very, very clear:"
"Never once in my career have I had Thanksgiving Dinner or exchanged X-Mas Gifts with anyone I report on, <at>Dontral1. I call it like I see it"
"I can respect that, <at>Ray_Ciaf. These conference and NBA Finals have been rough on me. My worse year on predictions BY FAR in my career :-)"
"Yes sir, <at>Evan_Giokas. Game 1. Picked the EXACT score. But it's been downhill ever since!"
"Folks in NY, <at>rabb415. That's who I wrote it for."
"It's called Hedging one's bets, <at>tazmanian10."
"I'm not going there, <at>NatBurner003. No need for all of that!"
"I already acknowledged that my overall prediction for the series was WRONG, <at>Jamesthebang. What else do you want me to do?"
"<at>JDab85 Thank you!"
"He would never do that, <at>MCITYBIZOY <at>KingJames <at>RealSkipBayless. He'd never give Skip the satisfaction."
"Who broke your heart? <at>Boima_BFREE"
"Thanks bro, <at>A1grindhard <at>stephenasmith"
"New CBA rules allows for teams to EXCEED their cap in order to re-sign a player, <at>BIBS2GO <at>ESPNNewYork <at>Chris_Broussard. NY will overpay."

"<at>TREV_mendous <at>stephenasmith 25-to-1"
"Clearly not enough, <at>JakeKores4 <at>stephenasmith <at>RealSkipBayless"
"Wouldn't bother me, <at>mcamp27 <at>stephenasmith"
"I believe so, too <at>Alton_Wade <at>RealSkipBayless <at>stephenasmith"
"Haaaaaaaaaa! Kobe calls me Mush (from the movie: Bronx Tale), <at>_OGeeKush. Billups always tells me: ""Don't Pick us."""
"<at>therealdodirty <at>RealSkipBayless <at>stephenasmith Thanks bro"
"Wouldn't mind either scenario, <at>utilizemind2. Either LeBron wins or the series becomes a thriller."
"He'll do it, <at>Showtime_Salako <at>KingJames <at>RealSkipBayless. But only because he'd want to deny all of y'all the satisfaction of"
"<at>Showtime_Salako <at>stephenasmith <at>KingJames <at>RealSkipBayless to saying he'd refused to man-up. Nothing more."
"<at>MrSpacely55 <at>stephenasmith Thank you."
"<at>aemcfarlin <at>stephenasmith <at>Jamesthebang I will."
"I'm not a phony, <at>Vin_Will3 <at>stephenasmith. I still don't believe they're the better team."
"Amen! <at>BrianEllingboe <at>stephenasmith"
"Nobody is as bad as me, <at>scheminjhart <at>RealSkipBayless. But I'm still here and u r still watching. So the 1 who needs to shut up is YOU."
"Thank you, <at>_isaiahbreton <at>stephenasmith"
"Melo doesn't have that pressure now because he doesn't have expectations, <at>SAIRR84. But he's a great talent and it demands more."
"Let's chill with the ""love"" nonsense, <at>Jbrennnn <at>therealtyy. I RESPECT the brother and what he's doing. He deserves props."
"<at>SAIRR84 <at>stephenasmith To hell with all of that. I'm stopping to appreciate the ""Love"" (haaaaaaa!!!!!!)"
"I don't know what you're talking about, <at>REALANTOINEFAIR. Jalen is my boy. We get along just fine. And he's welcomed on FIRST TAKE anytime."
"Yep, <at>FDelaware. Ain't that a damn shame!"
"Actually, I'd love to see a Game 7, <at>TwoWordsForYa. But I just don't think we're getting out of Miami."
"The game isn't over yet, but this is unbelievable. Chalmers, Cole and battier hitting 3's. And MIKE MILLER of all ppl. What's is going on!!!"
"What's up with all the hairline jokes, bro (haaaa!!!!!!!), <at>ImTracyMorgan"
"Today, <at>RealSkipBayless has to MAN UP and give it up to <at>KingJames. And I can't wait. FIRST TAKE coming at you, 10-to-Noon EST on ESPN2."
"Btw.......Dallas Mavs' owner Mark Cuban is in the house!"
"Puh-leeze, <at>VarandK <at>stephenasmith <at>mcuban. You definitely weren't watching."
"<at>GArocha87 <at>stephenasmith That's true."
"<at>nickgagliano <at>stephenasmith Thanks bro."
"My man <at>RyanRuocco is on ESPN New York (98.7FM) with yours truly right now until 3pm today. Talking <at>KingJames and more. 800.919.3776."
"Congrats on a great NBA Finals, <at>MagicJohnson. The <at>MiamiHEAT -- a 1st-class franchise led by your boy Riles -- truly deserved it."
"<at>Iconic_Baller <at>stephenasmith Thank you."
"<at>KALI_KID18 <at>stephenasmith Thanks, my man."
"<at>ginovalentino <at>stephenasmith Absolutely. You're correct. No argument here."
"<at>Kobestilldabest <at>stephenasmith He'll need help."
"<at>Loud_LoudPack <at>stephenasmith Why do you ask?"
"<at>Viper10701 <at>stephenasmith I'll miss you, too :-)"
"<at>rcorralejo91 <at>stephenasmith Thanks my man."
"<at>n_hayes1 <at>stephenasmith Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>B_Maher845 <at>stephenasmith Yes he is, sir. To his players, his personnel and the people HE cares about? Yes, he most certainly is."
"<at>tevantru15 <at>stephenasmith No! WTH is wrong with YOU?"
"<at>Fordfanhz17 <at>stephenasmith Robinson was virtually over the hill. And never won a title before that."
"Thank you so much, <at>TaurusBone"
"<at>KING_DJeezy <at>stephenasmith Yes Lawd!"

"<at>C_L_A_R_O <at>stephenasmith Let's hope so."

"<at>Exec2B <at>stephenasmith Thank you."
"I try to be bro, <at>johnadeleon"
"<at>sportzmen24 I will if ppl stop asking me questions. Brother won. I'm happy for him. I have nothing but praise to say about the brother!"
"<at>BoBreezy22 Thanks Bro!"
"<at>wcrcpo10 thanks bro!"
"<at>FloodDaBloc he is buggin!"
"<at>voguntolu Thank you sir!"
"It's beautiful to be here at Citi Field for this Yankees/Mets rubber match. But even better to see Swisher smack that 3-run shot. BEAUTIFUL!"
"<at>MichaelRosales6 Hopefully we will from time-to-time!"
"Sorry I neglected to tell y'all that FIRST TAKE was only on from 10-11am today and it's on ESPNews......NOT ESPN2!!!"
"<at>livewell614 some do; some don't. Generalizations don't get us anywhere. Self-defeating. No substance. If that's a company man, I'm it!"
"<at>Jakellz you have to play for a city that cares if you're to have any pressure applied."
"<at>TylerWorden13 No!"
"Initially, I didn't like this: http://t.co/At21ItZK that much. Certainly not better than ""All He Does Is Win Games."" But it's grown on me."
"Just a reminder: a special edition of FIRST TAKE is airing on ESPN at 7pm TONIGHT! Subject: NBA Draft. <at>RealSkipBayless is waiting for you!"
"In case you wanted a hint about what's gonna be on today's FIRST TAKE, here ya go: http://t.co/gmlDWhmN. It's on ESPNews today from 10-11pm."
"<at>chrish77clh Not true. Said POINT GUARD! Not overall. Flat-out lie, but why am I surprised!"
"<at>roblarry Not really. Just displaying common courtesy as often as I can."
"<at>obynoch Thanks!"
"<at>BABA37638873 I completely agree. I don't believe I'm a Big Deal at all."
"Here's what people like <at>Codmw32 don't get about my position on Tebow: I like the kid. I respect him. I just don't think he can throw. But.."
"what folks don't get is that when I bring up the Black Athlete, it's in DEFENSE of what them. My point: There are many God-Fearing, decent"
"athletes out there. Guys who are God-fearing, who never got in trouble, who believed in being role models. What shine did they get? Who"
"celebrated them? And when you're so quick to celebrate Tebow, what exactly are ppl trying to say? That he's the first? Puh-leeze. The point:"
"<at>TimTebow is not the first Good Guy and he won't be the last. Many preceded him. To ignore this is an insult to all of us. But especially"
"the Black Athlete who was out here long before him, living right, and never received the shine nor the opportunities accorded to him. Simple"
"And for those who didn't like what I just said, I could give less than a you know what. I said it and I mean every damn word of it."
"And Yes! I DID use more than 140 characters. Because I wanted to. Goodbye!!! See y'all tomorrow on FIRST TAKE at 10 a.m."
"<at>Huh? What are you talking about Bruh?"
"Urgent! Urgent. Ladies and Gentlemen. This is the real STEPHEN A. SMITH from ESPN. Please be aware there is a FAKE Stephen A out here who"
"Who's been reporting FALSE trade rumors. I have not reported anything. I am NOT covering the NBA Draft. Please be advised IT'S NOT ME!"
"And be aware of these individuals doing this. Again, I have not reported ANYTHING. No trades, pre-draft transactions, NOTHING! Any reporting"
"I do will take place over the airwaves of ESPN. Not on Twitter. Please be advised!!!"
"<at>ninjadxt For Sportscenter."
"<at>MrVietNguyen I wouldn't know."
"<at>PrinceTray The operative word is ""seem."" You celarly don't ""know"" what you're talking about b/c that's not true."
"<at>Mamba_Negro_RN Life!"
"<at>SHISCPrincess Had a wonderful time doing that!"
"<at>thebballteacher No worries. It won't work. Appreciate the support, though. Thank you!"
"<at>BBNewsHound Ignorance. His beef was with Skip. What show were you watching?"
"<at>Grugz29 And I love y'all back. Especially in Sydney."
"<at>Mray20 Don't you even dear!"
"<at>TimK954 Thanks my man. Much appreciated!"
"About to be on SPORTSCENTER right now. Talking USA Basketball, Celtics, Lamar Odom to the Clippers and more. Check it out!"
"Hope everyone enjoys their 4th of July. I'm off this week on vacation, but I WILL be back on Monday. Enjoy. Be safe. Don't drink and drive!"
"<at>KellzC5 pleasure was all mine!"
"I'm officially off vacation tomorrow morning when I return to Sportscenter at 10am. But I'm not missing Silva vs. Sonnen in UFC TONIGHT."
"This is what competition is all about. I don't bet against Silva. But he can't underestimate this guy. Sonnen's no joke. But Silva's the man"
"Damn! I've been looking so much forward to this fight, now that it's here...I'M NERVOUS. I want Silva to win. But I want a good fight!"
"Damn Anderson! Didn't think Sonnen would get him to the ground that early! I hate fights like this. Ground-and-pound. Neutralizes Silva!"
"Looks like a repeat of Fight #1 to me. I want to see what Sonnen can do standing up with Anderson! But doesn't look like that's gonna happen"
"Anderson's gotta find a way to stop fighting from his back. Damn!"
"Yyyeeeeaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!! You talk it, you've gotta walk it!"
"One thing needs to be said: all these UFC fighters have a lot of class. Love how they uplift their sport. I root for this sports popularity!"
"<at>Biz3rk_Jerk So do I."
"<at>buffandsweet33 Thanks Bro!"
"Fyi......I am officially off of vacation. Return on 1st Take tomorrow to pound down <at>RealSkipBayless and show up on Sportscenter. Lots 2 say"
"All this NBA talk. NFL. MLB. Just can't wait. Haven't been this fired up in quite a long time. So buckle up and get ready. I'm coming!"
"You wouldn't dare, <at>DonLegreca. You wouldn't dare :-)"
"Haaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>mikecstarr When I have the slightest idea what the hell you're talking about, I'll be sure to let you know!"
"<at>itsgabrielleu Niiiccceeee!!!!!"
"<at>KellzC5 Amen!"
"Okay, your boy is back. I'm loving what I'm seeing in Brooklyn, lukewarm about NY and feeling sorry for Mark Cuban in Dallas. Loving LA, BTW"
"Although OKC is still the best in the West, the Lakers are actually the ones with the best shot to beat Miami -- the favorites -- next year."
"Nash is a scoring threat, frees up Kobe and will make Bynum and Gasol happy. LA in the Finals turns Miami into a perimeter team. No Good MIA"
"In the East, can't sleep on Boston. Terry in place of Allen is not a huge drop off. But letting Allen get away to Miami? OOHHHH!!!"
"As for Knicks, let's stop it please. Love Kidd, but he's beyond his prime. Lin will need lots of tutoring. And Amare's health is the key."
"Until we know for sure that Amare's back and knees are healthy, Brooklyn has the best team in NY."
"As for Dallas, after losing Tyson Chandler, you lose Kidd and Terry and don't nab Deron Williams. I'll say this: Carlisle  deserves better."
"No need for me to go any further, for now. Check me out on FIRST TAKE tomorrow morning with <at>RealSkipBayless, after I'm on SPORTSCENTER."
"BTW....for all you ESPN New York (98.7FM) Radio lovers out there, I'll be filling in for Michael Kay all week long from 3-6pm."
"<at>LouisRd3 Agreed."
"<at>KidSwish_11 Not about Nash. It's about two 7-footers excited to play, capable of taking <at>KingJames post-game away. Just basketball."
"<at>KidSwish_11 Oh, did I forget to tell you that I still believe the Clippers could be better than the Lakers!"
"<at>allaboutfigures Couldn't see <at>KingJames once Chael got dropped. But he couldn't have been more hyped than me."
"<at>manduken <at>KingJames <at>RealSkipBayless <at>skitsOshow <at>rromo29 <at>SportsCenter I have no doubt about that."
"<at>zacoates Oh! I plan to be much, much better than that, bro."
"<at>In_Koolwetrust Nothing. Especially if they don't get Eric Gordon."
"Why do I even try to reach <at>RealSkipBayless? I don't know why I try to talk Basketball with this man on FIRST TAKE!"
"<at>BJustinKoppel <at>jblee2232 <at>rubensborges <at>chill4will <at>tubsnyk <at>lrsantos11 <at>teambjnba I certainly never said OKC was overrated."
"<at>JerryNyPr Not promoting. Just talking on Radio about how I feel. It's called doing my job."
"<at>23LOS So, are you trying to say you don't have a damn opinion? Please stop. Listen and learn."
"<at>wolfman_13 <at>DonLagreca He's getting paid by the Yankees. Shut up about Yankee players or go somewhere else to collect a paycheck."
"<at>90sKnicksFans <at>IamBrianJ <at>TheHonorableHaS You're lying. Because you don't have any."
"<at>BigDaddyPower Very Bad Taste."
"For folks walking around all ecstatic about your NY Knicks, here's something to think about: http://t.co/FvpfVTR1."
"Wow! <at>RealSkipBayless. I've got to admit, Cano was just embarrassing! Can't deny it!"
"<at>leoellis1911 <at>firsttake <at>RealSkipBayless Amen."
"<at>Tre_Sources Why do you care? Kobe's got 2 yrs left at $58.3 million. It's about NOW. Deal with later......later."
"<at>legitdawgbaby <at>realskipbayless I believed I mentioned the fact that there's 162 games."
"<at>andrew_esposito Who cares?"
"<at>ForrestLoveFood <at>realskipbayless <at>ThessoloniusO <at>LaMolllly :-):-):-)"
"<at>MadmanSteve12 Haaaaa. I loved it!"
"<at>StevenJamesPaul Okay!"
"<at>Mikey_Boyy didn't mean that the way it sounded. Don't know her at all."
"<at>FrankMc20 Turn the channel, bro! No problem here."
"<at>samaurya42 <at>MikeAndMike Who???"
"<at>Tricia_status <at>RealSkipBayless That was Hugh Douglas, not me :-)"
"<at>N_JustinWeTrust <at>RealSkipBayless Huh?"
"<at>DylanMullaney1 I would've. But that's such a ridiculous statement. So don't expect to hear from me again."
"<at>DeanShavelson that's not called a double-standard. It's called a CHOICE."
"<at>iamedgar_ That would be correct."
"<at>CoachMicah Idiocy. I happen to respect Mario Chalmers. Clearly you've ignored my 20-year track record. Too bad you don't have 1 to compare."
"<at>RonaldEScott Decent. But it won't get them anywhere without D-Rose."
"<at>GG057 who are you talking about?"
"<at>TheA_Train6 Thank you."
"<at>vaughnholloway <at>TheRealJRSmith What did I say about JR Smith, other than quoting what he told the media after their loss in Miami?"
"<at>jak20rabt <at>ndstacken I'm not Vegan. Trust me."
"<at>Jake_Dip Thank you. Deeply appreciate the kind words."
"<at>YaBoiLAJ <at>ESPNFirstTake <at>RealSkipBayless I believe he became one."
"<at>DamonMartin <at>AaronSimpson <at>JakeShieldsAJJ <at>macdanzigmma Tell'em to reach out to me. I'd be happy to talk to them."
"<at>hoeman2009 I'm no Vegan. Trust me."
"<at>kdupree88 You've been saying that since 1973 I assume."
"<at>djalfredarroyo I know this :-)"
"<at>PatIsWhite <at>skipbayless Not at all. <at>RealSkipBayless is a dear friend. He's just crazy. Especially when it comes to LeBron and Tebow."
"<at>JOHNTORRES_BX More Nets' games on TV. More eyeballs."
"<at>90sKnicksFans We wish."
"<at>HoffmanHarry And exhausting."
"<at>LouTasi <at>90sKnicksFans it is crazy. You're talking regular season. I'm talking championships."
"<at>hleezyfbaby <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>realskipbayless Haaaaaaaa."
"<at>StopItInc Stop it!"
"<at>johnnyamartin <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>RealSkipBayless <at>KingJames My sentiments, exactly."
"<at>_heather2 <at>realskipbayless I try, girl. I try."
"<at>hleezyfbaby <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>RealSkipBayless Get over it. If we disagree on every single thing, it would be phony. We're real. Enjoy it."
"<at>AirplaneErik They're not great. They just don't have to be because the Knicks are so much less."

"<at>jmcman13 I'm sure I'll get over losing you, sir."
"<at>Jamaicanhitman <at>LouTasi <at>90sKnicksFans The best move the Knicks can make is making sure Amar'e Stoudemire gets healthy."
"<at>90sKnicksFans <at>LouTasi Whatever."

"Let me be clear about my feelings on Penn State. This is about SEXUAL MOLESTATION. Anyone quick to jump to Joe Pa's or PSU's defense should"
"be ashamed of themselves. Children were victimized. That's the bottom line. Nothing else matters. The only thing we should be talking about"
"is when will PSU's football program will receive THE DEATH PENALTY. At least a 5-five ban. Period."

"<at>bubuhuang What does this mean?"
"Knicks' brass has already decided to let Jeremy Lin head to Houston. But that doesn't mean owner Dolan won't change his mind by 11:50 2nite."
"We'll see what happens. Lin is no scrub, but I'm not losing sleep over the thought of him leaving. He doesn't make them better than Miami,"
"Chicago, Boston or even Brooklyn. So we'll see how things go down. My man <at>RyanRuocco and yours truly are talking about it on ESPN New York"
"(98.7FM) on our radio show. We'll see how it all goes down. Talk to y'all later."
"About to be on Sportscenter right now for 2 min before letting loose on FIRST TAKE at 10am on ESPN2."

"<at>THA_TROOF <at>ESPN_FirstTake Thanks bro."
"<at>icewater3001 My man, <at>RealSkipBayless is a friend. Of course he would say something like that. Debating doesn't make us enemies."

"<at>esco1972 Thank you so much, Richie."
"<at>algee3290 <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>RealSkipBayless The last thing I have to provide is my sources. My info speaks for itself. Always has."

"<at>algee3290 <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>RealSkipBayless Stop Lovin and drinking the Kool Aid."
"<at>adamtraweek And you're ignorant. So I guess that means we've both got problems. I'm sure I'll get over it. You? I'm not so sure."
"<at>Nick_DiGiacomo <at>RealSkipBayless <at>RobParkerESPN <at>ESPN_FirstTake Haaaaaaaaaaa."
"<at>Rell1221 <at>RealSkipBayless That's what I'm talking about."
"<at>TheJoshBranham Why are you ignoring the near $40-million Lin would've counted vs. the Knicks' books? Love how folks can spend others money."
"<at>icewater3001 <at>realskipbayless Yes, you do. We're friends. He's just crazy, that's all."

"<at>MooIsTeamClean Are you up this morning? Are you entertained? Then cherish it, money. Enjoy."
"<at>Ciroc_B0i I guess so :-)"
"Thank you so much, <at>DERIIFOUNDATION. May God Bless you and your family as well as he's blessed mine. Today. And everyday."

"<at>spidertcg31 I'm sure he'll get over it."
"<at>Digmedaddyo Perhaps. We'll see."
"<at>Nick_DiGiacomo That's all that matters. It would be boring if you always agreed with me."
"Folks are getting on my damn nerves. Lin is OKAY. The Knicks didn't lose the second-coming of Chris Paul. Plus, folks are missing the boat:"
"Lin's departure puts the pressure on Melo and Amar'e. They've got to step up and get it done. No excuses. No time to waste. It's about NOW!!"
"Neither Melo, Amar'e nor anyone else with the Knicks will have the luxury of being distracted by LinSanity. It's not going to be about him."
"It's going to be about ballers, highly paid ones, who are suppose to step up and ball. It's time for Melo to show us more. For Amar'e to"
"earn his dollars. For the Knicks to advance beyond the First Round in the playoffs. W/ or w/o Lin, it should happen. Period."
"As for D-Howard, he should've been in B'klyn. That's his fault. And now that that appears out of the question, Lakers should be the place."
"But more importantly, D-Howard needs to man-up and speak on his own behalf instead of letting folks provide stuff on ticker and twitter."
"He needs to speak up for himself and stop letting others define his image/character. He needs to do it himself. Stop running and hiding."
"It's time! He can't soft-ball and laugh his way out of all this mess. If he didn't create this mess, he needs to say so and why, and move on"
"For those of you who didn't see my column on Jeremy Lin's departure from the Knicks, no need to go any further: http://t.co/ZsWPeOPM  "

"<at>firststurg haaaaaaa!!!!!!!"
"<at>CMallory7 Takes one to know one!"
"My thoughts on today: Adam Scott's collapse is great for golf. So is Tiger's 3rd-place finish. Dream Team struggled, but it happens."
"Also....absolutely can't wait to hear what the NCAA does to Penn State. DEATH PENALTY is warranted here. Plus, some NFL players need to be"
"Checked, as well. There must always be law and order. Too many folks are not realizing that. Damn Shame!"

"<at>WestsideCorna Sad that you'd waste your time on such futile efforts."
"<at>FakeEspys Damn! I didn't win that honor yet? :;)"

"<at>TStew_NYG Neither!"
"<at>ouderkirkmike why???"
"<at>kingjabiri23 Thank You!"
"<at>T_Pott2 Not even a little bit. In my perfect world, all those wonderful students would choose another school to avoid the stain caused."

"<at>Ty_Yost <at>RealSkipBayless Then you need to go and get a Webster's dictionary to learn the true meaning of the word."
"No sir, <at>_Marcotte_. <at>RealSkipBayless and myself are two dudes debating sports like everyone else. Don't hate b/c you're not doing it."

"<at>OfficialAlvex Amen."
"<at>bnew78 Whatever! I've made my position clear. not about to argue about this anymore."
"Look Damnit! I've stated my position. I wish PSU were fined $200-million instead of just $60 million. I hope the kids/Coaches transfer."
"CHILDREN were raped. Molested. And folks turned a blind eye/deaf ear to what was going on. There's nothing to discuss here. NOTHING AT ALL."

"<at>rbru15 Bro, then don't listen!"
"<at>Pboyz4 No comment."
"<at>airbornchris I hear you. But we're 2 hours. 10 minutes on Tebow -- while nauseating for ME -- doesn't define the show. We do more than that"

"Oh, Stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless. You know better. Just stop it!"
"<at>t_upham Stop drug user. It's not good for you. Clearly you're on something if you think for a second we're scripted!"
"<at>RetroFutureView it's inappropriate for me to say right now in light of the Aurora, Colo. Shooting!"
"Let's all take a moment to sent our heartfelt condolences to Coach Andy Reid and his family for their loss. A pain all of wish to avoid."
"I'm on vacation folks. But I'll be back on Monday, ready to go. Don't worry: I'll hear everything. And I will RESPOND. Just not this week:-)"
"Oh, btw.....I love my man Rob Parker like a brother. But his outfit today was an ABOMINATION! Like all the others (haaa)"

"Want to take a moment to thank my brother ""Razz"" Rasbury for his piece on me. Very nice and very much appreciated. Thank you, sincerely!"
"Barring any last minute snag, D-Howard will be a Laker by tomorrow. Bynum will be in Philly. And we'll all expect a Lakers/Heat Finals."
"Unless OKC or the Clippers have something to say to the Lakers. Only Boston has a chance of derailing the Heat in the East!!!"
"Not so fast, <at>SnoopDogg. OKC and Miami may have something to say about that!"
"No doubt, my man!"
"<at>kmdomingo They wouldn't dear sit down with the likes of me!"
"<at>ASmooth70 Thank You!"

"Good Call, <at>JalenRose. Go ahead and block'em. It's very liberating :-)"
"<at>mlocust off vacation on Monday!"
"No problem, <at>BShellz30. Get a degree, put 20 years in the business and climb the ladder like the rest of us and we'll gladly debate you!"
"I was born ready for <at>RealSkipBayless,  <at>iamcomediansims. You ain't said nothing but a word!"
"<at>yonni24k A bad or good week is defined by what I feel I need, bruh! Now when you think so. U see me telling you when to take vacation?"

"Amen! <at>WatchThe_TeeVee. Let them try to change my stance if they like. I know what I've said."

"Guess who's back! Buckle up. 1st Take coming at you right now!"
"<at>Erwiee <at>stephenasmith been to barbados plenty of times. Sandy Lane."

"<at>Dj_KyddKollege <at>RealSkipBayless <at>stephenasmith Pay attention to the Jets' receivers. Then you'll know what I'm talking about."
"That's right, I said it: Tebow gives the Jets the best chance to win. Look at their receivers. Their passing game. All they can do is RUN!!!"
"Thank you Dear!"
"<at>SupermanCortez Haaaa. Thanks!"
"<at>Quise4Prezident Yes! Until the Jets get some receivers."
"<at>TimmyKing182 Turn the channel!"
"My intent was NOT to call out Eve Lazada at all. Don't know her. All we can go by is what we see on TV."
"And based on THAT......I stand by what I said. Every word of it!"
"Those words never came out of my mouth, <at>MOTCMRWILSON. I would never say that about another man's woman. Don't attach those words to me."

"<at>CClark420 I do occasionally."
"<at>PLAYBOY860 why? What did they say?"
"<at>TheCab121 Yes!"
"<at>IronmanMastin I agree, but you're still exaggerating. We debate 13-to-15 topics a day. 2 on Tebow doesn't define the show. Relax!"
"Guess who's back? 1st Take coming at ya right now"
"Glad y'all are showing me love for that last segment on 1st Take today. Loved doing it. Loved talking of my man,Poolie."
"Jets Coach Rex Ryan is on Radio on ESPN NY (98.7FM) right now with me and <at>RyanRuocco. Check it out."
"Y'all get on outta here with all your compliments for me today on 1st Take. I'm the LOVE DOCTOR (Haaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!)"
"<at>LennonEmpire Love it. My favorite comedian!"
"<at>MQomaq Didn't call out a soul. Just doing my job, being fair, and pointing out what we've seen on television."
"<at>BeijingMF_South What's preposterous is you're making time to point it out.....as if you have nothing better to do, which you don't."
"<at>lakerdamon24 I've never hit a woman in my life. Never will."
"<at>lakerdamon24 Don't tell me what the hell I sound like. Tell me what I SAID! I specifically said NO MAN should hit a woman."

"<at>KahunaMax Goodbye."
"<at>SM_412 <at>_Noire Goodbye."

"<at>spencerkoch32 good point. You might be right."

"FIRST TAKE coming right at ya at the top of the hour. If nothing else, we're as real as it gets."
"You need to thank me, <at>jmccallahan. We'd debate Tebow for an hour a day, instead of a segment, if it were not for me :-)"
"Special s/o to Steelers' LaMarr Woodley. Don(ed $60K to pay fees for EVERY Saginaw (Mich.) Public Schools Student-Athlete. WONDERFUL GESTURE"

"<at>clubalane As a Journalist/commentator, sure! But I was asked if I were an owner what would I do about Lovie. And I stand by what I've said."
"<at>JSmithh34 Who cares! I know you and <at>RealSkipBayless are wrong. I don't need your confirmation."
"<at>jaylee_222 Fine. Call me when they win one."
"<at>TRUmavsfan78 Thank you my dear. Much appreciated. But....TO HELL WITH ME! Keep the hubby happy :-)"

"Just some thoughts on the NFL today: RGIII and Luck both looked good enough. T.O. Got a little loose this weekend. So did Eli Manning. But.."
"The Giants still lost. Chi gives me reason to think they'll have a say in the NFC. But the more I think of it, the 49ers should be favorites"
"Man, I can't wait for the NFL season to begin. As for college FB, it comes down to USC and Alabama for me. LSU and Okla could make noise but"
"It's all about the Tide, their running game with that off. Line, vs. Barkley with Woods and Lee at wideouts for the Nat'l Title. That's the"
"Game I absolutely want to see. Unless, of course, Bama falls to Arkansas, LSU or South Carolina. Then all bets are off."

"<at>ChadedUp Mass Communications!"
"<at>WillieWayne06 I try!"
"Folks need to calm down. On FIRST TAKE, race isn't being mentioned as if it's a problem. It's mentioned to articulate different perspectives"
"Ppl need to grow up and stop acting as if just the mere mention of race means someone has done something wrong. It doesn't. Grow up!"
"Dez Bryant is young. He's made mistakes. Jerry Jones is trying to protect his investment, and that's the way it goes."
"If Dez hadn't messed up, he wouldn't be in this situation. It's not a race issue, but that doesn't mean racial dynamics aren't involved."
"Anyone BLACK acting  like they weren't taken aback by Dallas' implementation of rules -- no alcohol, curfews, no strip clubs -- is lying!"

"Thank y'all for watching FIRST TAKE today. Hope y'all enjoyed the show."
"<at>thecmpro on what?"
"Yes, <at>reggie_bush. So does the DNC. If we can have games all over the place, we damn sure should highlight politicians controlling our lives"

"Know President Obama is going to turn it out on Thursday night. I expect Clinton to do well, too. But it's all about the debates to me."
"I'm interested in facts, ideas and the future. Speeches are great, inspiring. But we issues will determine my vote, not emotion."
"I'm gonna say this right now: Pres. Obama is someplace with tears in his eyes right now -- CRYING over that SENSATIONAL speech by his wife."
"Michelle Obama worked it. Right down to the core of his words, the tears in her eyes. The passion oozing from her breath. SENSATIONAL SPEECH"
"The kind of speech that would shake any man to his core, knowing he has a woman by his side that supportive. What a fantastic FIRST LADY."
"I still want issues, though. Love the speeches. Appreciate them. But that won't determine my vote. REGISTERED INDEPENDENT!"

"Yeah, <at>RealSkipBayless got on my last nerve today with all his fawning over the Cowboys, but they were the better team. Can't wait 4 Sunday."
"We'll see with the Jets will do vs. The Bills. What the Steelers will do in Denver. What Green does vs. Baltimore, what RGIII does vs Saints"
"For right now, however, I'm disgusted with the Giants. The way the Cowboys look, if the Eagles are close, then the Giants may miss playoffs."

"I've just been alerted that Ike Taylor had a few words for me. I'm tied up for the next hour. But I will respond by 9pm EST. Count on it!"
"Yo <at>Ike_SwagginU, let me try and break this down to you, Bruh: In no way was I serious when I talked of ""banishment"" for you. THAT PART I"
"Was only playing about. I always in favor of any athlete getting paid, and in no way did I mean to come across as serious when I used that"
"Word. For that I apologize if it was misconstrued. But be clear <at>Ike_SwagginU, that's the only damn thing I'm apologizing for. You need to"
"Understand that critiquing your performance is part of what I do for a living. It's what I have done, it's what I did today and it's what I"
"Will continue to do for as long as I'm being PAID to do it. If you have a problem with that, I have no idea what to tell you. May I suggest"
"However, <at>Ike_SwagginU that had you put as much effort and hostility in not making Tebow look like Joe Montana, you wouldn't have to deal w/"
"Anything you felt the need to deal with today. I love the Steelers. I love what coach Mike Tomlin and the Steelers organization reps. What I"
"Don't love is an otherwise quality CB ending his season with one of the most HORRIFIC performances I've ever seen from a CB in NFL HISTORY."
"It was just one game <at>Ike_SwagginU. I totally get that. It shouldn't - and won't -- define you. Please know that I will compliment you in a"
"Heartbeat when you do something good. But if you're ever perform that GOD-AWFUL again, I'm going to call it like I see it."
"Your job is to PLAY. My job is to CRITIQUE how you play. You're blessed to do what you, as am I. I'm not complaining about it, so why are U?"
"Again <at>Ike_SwagginU, the respect is here. So is the sincere appreciation for your position, taking care of your family, etc. So I will NEVER"
"Use ""Banishment"" or anything like that again. But if you ever left a no-passing-skills Tebow -- or anyone who even looks like him -- shred u"
"Like that again, YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT IT. On TV. On Radio. In Print. In the Locker room. In your home. In the streets. EVERYWHERE."
"That's just the way it's going to be. All you have to do to prevent it is BALL.......like most of your teammates were, and usually, do."
"Respectfully, STEPHEN A!"
"Good luck this weekend. And especially the next........once you may possibly face Tebow again."
"Sitting her chillin at the Jets' Game. Don't know if NY is this good or Fitzpatrick/Bills are this bad, but Sanchez looks good throwing ball"
"Tebow won't be needed much if Sanchez keeps throwing the ball this way :-)"
"Game over. Kerley returns punt 60 Yds for TD. Bills ain't coming back from this. Not against this Jets' Defense."
"Oh! Message for <at>RealSkipBayless: Don't think for 1 second you're gonna give credit to Tebow if he accumulates yds in garbage time. No Sir!"
"That hit that just got put on Fred Jackson looks like it may have him out. He got out and walked off. Hard to imagine how he did it. Ugly!"
"<at>CoachSquatty That's a damn good point. I've made it before on TV and I'm going to make sure to make it again. Thanks for reminding me."

"I know Philly won, but can't believe how badly Vick played. Not Good. RGIII was big-time, but we knew the Saints' D wasn't all that. More..."
"Falcons surprised me. I still believe Adrian Petersen should not be playing yet. And the Jets' win doesn't mean much to me yet. Come back to"

"Employee in LA. Here's the deal: I've never yelled in a restaurant in my life. Certainly never did this. Never happened. Never would. My Mom"
"Trained me far better than that. It's incredibly sad folks would stoop to such low tactics to try and smear me. Just as bad that DEADSPIN"
"Would allow it. Damn Shame. No matter. I've dealt with worse. At least I can applaud folks for spelling my name correctly. Appreciate that!"
"That's night satirical, <at>caneesq. They're portraying it as if it's true and it's not. Would never do that. It's B.S."

"<at>wodnicki differently. Just the way it is."
"No, <at>JoshJae. My boycott ONLY  refers to Mayweather or Pacquaio PPV's without them fighting one another. Nothing else. Huge Boxing fan here"
"Watching the fight. Chavez Jr. May be younger, but he looks older. Lost entirely too much weight. Has nothing. Martinez shutting him OUT!"
"Had Chavez winning round 6, then Martinez throws an 8-punch combination......all connecting! Wow! Even round, though."
"Martinez appears to be the Pernell Whitaker to Chavez Jr. The quick, elusive southpaw that gave Chavez Sr. Fits many years ago. Too much"
"Just embarrassing. Freddie Roach -- Chavez Jr. Trainer -- is saying DURING THE FIGHT his guy can't handle Martinez Speed, calling Martinez"
"The young guy, even though he's 37 years old. Unbelievable."
"OMG! OMG! OMG! Martinez gets dropped twice in the 12th Round. Re-making of his dad vs. Meldrick Taylor. OMG! Unbelievable. Unbelievable!!!!!"
"<at>resnbledoubt Peeps! I specifically said I was banning PPV with Mayweather/Pacquaio -- NOT BOXING ALTOGETHER. Pls quote me accurately!"
"<at>DramTones28 He was falling anyway because he was hurt. I don't see that as a slip. Don't care what referee said."
"No, <at>AD1216. Chavez Sr. Was legit. But he did lose to Pernell Whitaker. That draw was highway robbery!"

"<at>NicoBloomjew agreed. But great way to close."
"<at>christina41289 Nope. Only talking Round 12, not entire fight."

"Sanchez to Santonio Holmes.......caught Ike Taylor looking for help on NY's 3 Tight-End look instead of just defending Holmes. Damn!"
"No Sir, <at>richeisen. Coughlin was doing the Barking. Schiano was just listening, knowing he didn't have a leg to stand on."
"Tell me about it, <at>DwyaneWade."
"Tebow in, but didn't throw the ball. Seems sensible to me. On another note, good defense on Holmes by Ike Taylor. Just being fair here."

"<at>WillieWayne06 Fair is a place where they judge pigs."
"<at>NYJET_Prime Then go watch her."
"<at>BlairLillis Let'em keep coming. They don't go after Nobody's. Remember that."
"<at>jay_fyda Don't ever do that. Your education is far more important than our show."
"<at>49erswant6rings how many times do I keep telling you: DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT!"
"<at>kinghenry_III So!!!!!!!"
"<at>LuckieOwen Damn good kid. Parents did a helluva job."
"<at>Megan_Broadway We'd lose to you :-)"
"<at>Dance_mob973 Haaa! Comical."
"So do most, <at>ZiceyBraumseil. Folks just busy hating to admit it."
"FIRST TAKE'S IN THE HOUSE right now!!! Holla at ya boys!!!"
"<at>bkhuber7 You're entitled to be a bit lost like anybody else :-)"
"<at>JonnyNeo1 You must be one too since you're so knowledable about it!"
"Your ire is misguided, <at>_BreakinAnkles. <at>Ochocinco is embarrassing himself by flip-flopping and not defending himself to some degree."
"What has <at>ochocinco ever done, <at>_BreakinAnkles? It's too much watching this dude do this to himself. If he's wrong, settle it privately."
"Apologize and move on, <at>_BreakinAnkles. But <at>ochocinco shouldn't be doing all of this. Sorry! Can't take watching it."
"<at>Tha_Deacon_ actually, his hands are very big for his size."
"I'm about to interview Manny Pacquaio RIGHT NOW on ESPN New York (98.7FM). Spoke to him earlier on TV. This will be just as intense."
"<at>justinross1 That's what I do, Boss!"
"Absolutely, <at>ExNiceGuyNowLOL. I believe in <at>FloydMayweather. But I'm tired of seeing him and Pacman fight everyone else. Boxing needs this!"
"<at>lookitsvikvik Then don't watch because I'm not changing."
"<at>JoseZambrano Thanks Bro!"
"<at>joebatts10 You know better!"
"For those who missed today's FIRST TAKE, especially the part with us and Pacquaio and Marquez, here ya go: http://t.co/AVG7EZrH. Worth look!"
"<at>bryantstudios Not buying it. But I'll watch somewhere someone else has bought. It :-)"
"Haaaa! No worries."
"<at>SamyEastmall a little bit. But he's just not that relevant to me anymore."
"<at>jDedering Moss in his Prime. But Megatron's a stud!"
"<at>Ron_Burgundy94 a dream earned through years of hard work to get to this point."
"<at>DeShawnHamer Thank You so much!"
"<at>joedoe27526689 Not so! Just providing a different perspective since everyone else had something to say. It's called connecting the dots."
"Giants/Panthers...... http://t.co/baKWQlNx"
"More on Giants.... http://t.co/3wQQND2b"
"Damn! I'm wrong already. Looking bad picking against the Giants. Both <at>RealSkipBayless and <at>RyanRuocco are looking like prophets right now."
"Damn!"
"<at>chidichidibang Where were you last week when I pick all three games better than him? In your diapers?"
"More Giants..... http://t.co/eZUqKmsp"
"I'm a big dummy: http://t.co/AylObqSk"
"<at>MM2UMPOETRY Hell, I don't blame him for that :-)"
"<at>Salvant_Breaux Was gonna respond until you were disrespectful. Now you can go kiss off!"
"<at>MMAEinstein Jon Jones and Anderson Silva. Bad boys, no doubt."
"<at>pwork21 Nope. I said RIGHT NOW he's looking better."
"<at>bxdom Thank you for listening. I could care less why!"
"<at>Investments360C We reached out to Floyd to respond he he never answered."
"That's RIGHT!!!!! The man! Derek JETERRRRRRRRRRR!!!"
"I don't know about anyone else, but I'm barely interested in Mich/ND. This Fla. State/Clemson game is the joint. Robinson has been awful BTW"
"<at>Real_TonyG Nope!"
"Watkins throw under that wildcat formation looked better than anything Tebow's thrown (Haaaaa)"
"Clicked back over to Michigan/ND just in time to see ANOTHER TURNOVER by Denard Robinson. Damn!"
"Just like I told y'all, Jets offense is not good. The vacillate b/t Sanchez not throwing the ball well and receivers (Hill) dropping passes."
"They'd just better not lose this week, or they'll be 1-4 come week 5."
"See, that's exactly the damn kind of pass that will get Sanchez benched."
"Tebow runs wrong route. Ball hits him upside his helmet/head. Lawd have mercy!"
"Even I can tell that <at>Timtebow should've been used in that last red zone sequence."
"Hard to believe, but if the Jets lose you've gotta look at Cromartie a little bit. That was one helluva move put on him by Hartline!"
"Yes <at>RealSkipBayless. Dallas just survived. What else is new."
"We already know how it's gonna work out, <at>itsgabrielleu. It's the Dolphins."
"Congrats to the lucky you-know-what Jets. Carpenter helped them BIGTIME."
"Totally agree with you, <at>RyanRuocco. He's about the only dude who did so offensively for the Jets!"
"Un-freakin-believable. Vick gets popped on 3rd and goal, fumbles and has it returned 98 yds for a TD. Arizona 24-0. Eagles look AWFUL."
"Don't want this to happen, but this is what will lead to the end of Andy Reid and Vick. Vick taking too many hits. No protection. But he"
"Can't drop back to pass like he has all day, holding onto football. Shameful performance."
"<at>aaburns55 Evidently, you do all the time!"
"Before anyone even asks, I had no problem with Jay Pharoah's impersonation of me on SNL. I think he's hysterical. All love!!!"
"Bigtime call by Tomlin to go for it on 4th down. But Steelers need to close the deal. This game should not have been close."
"FIRST TAKE is about to come at you. Vick/Eagles, Manning/Broncos, Pat, Texans, Jets/Revis, Cowboys, Officials and more. ESPN2 at top of hour"
"<at>sfzando Then obviously you're not impressed!"
"<at>Riedski Haaaaaa!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>jmccallahan We went 2 days last week without mentioning Tebow once. I'm working with <at>RealSkipBayless. That's a bigtime improvement."
"Look at who's on my radio show with <at>RyanRuocco right now: <at>RealSkipBayless. Lawd! What is this world coming to."
"<at>Grecko4371 Who's that?"
"<at>Kfernandez8 just for the same reason you're punk, sorry self is finding the reason to spew profanity at me now."
"<at>MWM1977 And he didn't get the proper respect until then, either!"
"He'll turn them around for you, <at>itsgabrielleu. There isn't a greater motivational leader in Sports History than Ray Lewis. I'm serious."
"Watching this Green Bay/Seattle Game. I know Seahawks are tough but this might be the most ATROCIOUS performance by an off. Line I've seen."
"Don't tell me there's an excuse for ANY TEAM surrendering 7 Sacks in a half.....especially if it's GB and you're suppose to protect Rodgers."
"I'm sorry......that's 8 Sacks now. This one was on Rodgers, though. He should've thrown it away. This is unbelievable."
"Man, <at>ItotheAN, you have no idea how badly I wish that would happen. I'd love to be next Howard Cosell. But America won't allow it. Oh Well!"
"Will someone put an end to these substitute referees. What a horrible, horrible roughing the passer call vs GB to continue that Sea Drive."
"Plus, there's been 4-consecutive calls. This is so bad, it can't be put into words. Just a complete unmitigated disaster. Just horrible."
"That's it! I'm done. CLEARLY AN INTERCEPTION. The NFL should be ashamed of itself for allowing this officiating to regress to this point."
"JUST DISGRACEFUL! ABSOLUTE ROBBERY IN THE NFL. The league has thrown away it's integrity. That can't say anything to the players anymore."
"Golden Tate with a Blatant pass interference on Sam Shields. Then Jennings had the ball, brings it to his chest. All Tate has on ball is arm"
"Horrible! Just Horrible.If I'm the Packers, I would refuse to go back out on the field to be there for the xtra pt. I just wouldn't do it."
"If the NFL wants to maintain any credibility whatsoever, it should OVERTURN this decision IMMEDIATELY. This game should be awarded to GB."
"I CAN'T WAIT for FIRST TAKE this morning. What I saw was a damn DISGRACE. That's all I have to say . See y'all on ESPN2 at top of the hour."
"For those who didn't see FIRST TAKE today, here ya go: http://t.co/AVG7EZrH. That is.....when you finish listening to me and <at>RyanRuocco on"
"ESPN New York (98.7FM)."
"That's right, <at>justsanaa. Show the proper amount of love to my boy <at>KevinFrazier please!"
"<at>alloydesq Hmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!! Speaking Arabic now?"
"I have no doubt about the visual talents :-)"
"Ya lost me?"
"Yep."
"I don't remember! :-)"
"I do NOT like -- nor appreciate -- the cartoon on Cam Newton. We'll talk about that on FIRST TAKE on ESPN2. Coming at you right now!!!!!!!!"
"I've seen the tweets re my remarks on Cam. Let me be clear: I DON'T REGRET A DAMN THING I SAID. Meant every word of it. Every single word."
"Pul-leeze, <at>Longtabsigo. You can kick rocks with that nonsense. I haven't criticized Vick? McNabb? JaMarcus Russell? You hear what u want!"
"<at>UQMAGXBRASCO That's what makes me.....ME :-)"
"<at>FootballBat1975 Haaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>gavinhall11 Thank You, Gavin!"
"<at>nonamegodson Agreed!"
"<at>drop2d Thank You!"

"<at>MakingThatDough Thanks Gina!"
"<at>jasonwe18566962 Then go away.....so you're not divided. I won't miss you."
"<at>DanglingPat when you have something intelligent to say, I'll give a response."
"<at>mrtouchdown704 I won't bother calling you what you are!"
"<at>DJness_BCKent guess so, by accident!"
"<at>1fabkay1 KD is the man! No.2 behind LeBron."
"<at>theRealKLud Amen!"
"Do you ever listen, <at>dukefan4rule? I thoroughly explained he was TOPS, but you have to get that chip w/o celebrating like you have one."
"<at>getmoney4208 thanks my man!"
"<at>HaiImLoki just keeping watching and keep your mouth shut!"
"Oh Damn!!! http://t.co/J2atrupg"
"Thank Goodness!!! http://t.co/GPmRriy7"
"That Damn Flacco!!! http://t.co/o7hBIA64"
"Oooh!!! Trent Richardson!!!! http://t.co/zwM6ZjxJ"
"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! http://t.co/5mdfWQAu"
"Uh oh!!!! http://t.co/NYfvZbgu"
"Are the Giants who we think they are? http://t.co/d6GlIzQM."
"Let Dino Costa say whatever he wants about me, <at>unstableMIC. I respect the hell out of that man as a Radio Host. All he had to do was call."
"I never once called anyone racist, <at>LanhamTroy. I said I was uncomfortable and I stand by it. That's how I felt. Was just being honest."
"Once again, <at>DinoCosta is entitled to his opinion. I'm entitled to mine. I respect the hell out of that man's ability as a Radio Host."
"I take absolutely no offense to what ppl are saying <at>DinoCosta said about me. He's earned the right to have his opinion. #Respect#"
"Nah, <at>leninRodrguez. He's a damn good radio host. I don't have to agree with him to respect him. I play on MY level. Won't sink to another's"
"<at>Acnetame Absolutely correct!"
"<at>JagBull1 You should be drug tested. No way Wade is washed up!"
"<at>JagBull1 With D-Rose injury? Pul-leeze."
"I have no idea what he said, <at>BjAnacker. I just heard he was critical."
"<at>dwaynemcfarlane Nope. Honestly don't know what he specifically said."
"<at>johnnnyo666 he's entitled to his opinion, too. So be it. Different opinions make the world go round. Guess what: still meant what I said."
"<at>SIlverRazar I stand up every day bro. I have 20 years of proof. You want to come w/ an insult, you need to come better than that,"
"<at>KillianRyan_ Won't be the last. So what!"
"<at>erush710 Nothing to say. Wasn't aware he said anything about me until an hour ago."
"<at>ITZ_M3_Y0 he's entitled to his opinion. That's a fact. He damn sure didn't change mine."
"<at>keithsfuller Hall of Famer. Mad respect for the man. Happy he's going out this way!"
"<at>Marving1906 :-)"
"<at>BjAnacker Thanks my man."
"<at>All4kash Thanks Bro!"
"<at>IsaacMcBride I AM almost 20 yrs older than LeBron. I'm lucky it's not worse :-)"
"<at>macmason09 I respect his abilities as a radio host. Hatin' on me doesn't change that. Doesn't change my position on any matter, either."
"<at>AJCaplan Who is this?"
"<at>magicmeech9 Thank you for listening enough to notice!"
"<at>DMVballer9 With big-time influence comes big-time responsibility. The smart one is one who's humble enough not to abuse it."
"<at>SkinnydaBarber1 Thank You!"
"<at>That1Roger Amen!"
"Btw......I just read what Whitlock had to say about my comments in his column on Cam Newton. I had no problem with it whatsoever. No biggie."
"Whitlock is entitled to his opinion and, being honest, it was a damn-good one. Multiple perspectives are always good. BUT...just like Dino.."
"He hasn't changed my position one bit either. I know what I said, what I meant and how I feel. I stand by every damn word I said on 1st TAKE"
"Yo! Yo! Gotta give my man, <at>ProducerAmadeus some love. He's the one who produced <at>ESPN_FirstTake new theme song w/ Wale. #Much Respect!"
"Another thing: can't begin to put into words how hyped I am about this upcoming NBA season. It's apropo than the Heat's media day was today."
"Miami is the obvious favorites. As far am I'm concerned, only LA and OKC has a shot to knock'em off. And the days of criticizing one Mr."
"One Mr. <at>KingJames has come to an end. He answered the bell. Definitely has shut me up. I'm giving the man his props. Now it's all about"
"HOW MANY? There's nothing else to say about <at>KingJames or <at>DwyaneWade. Will it be 2,3 or 4. That's the question. But the days of questioning"
"What LeBron is made of are over. I personally have nothing else to say. <at>RealSkipBayless is an entirely different matter, of course."
"<at>Crotchton Disagree. I stand by every single word I said on FIRST TAKE. Not wavering one iota."
"Yes! I heard what Mr. Graca said about me, <at>MadDogRadio. Completely uncalled for, the personal stuff. But that's the way it goes. So be it!"
"<at>jmac198726 nope! Waste of time."
"<at>jeremyDcannon NEVER!"
"<at>Heiss413 True dat! Got love Stalley!"
"This is unbelievable. The 49ers are running <at>TimTebow plays better than the Jets do for Tebow. Lawd have mercy."
"Glad you know it <at>RyanRuocco. Haaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Can't believe I'm about to say this, bit it may be time for <at>TimTebow. Sanchez looks awful right now. Fans are booing. Might as well!"
"This is how embarrassing things are: MetLife stadium is still loud...b/c 49ER fans Are all over the place. The Jets are atrocious. Horrible."
"And there's no reprieve in-sight. Revis out! Holmes out! Sanchez looks awful and even Tebow looks like he can't run. Pathetic!"
"This is what happens when you neglect your offense and try to fool folks into believing <at>TimTebow and Tony Sparano are saviors.Sad!"
"Oh Stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless. Don't even try to make this about <at>TimTebow. They collective stink. Nobody's sparking them today."
"I believe Sproles drop will be huge!!!!!!!"
"Actually, because of this holding penalty, dude may miss this FG!"
"<at>BC101089 Ya Think! :-)"
"FIRST TAKE'S coming at the top of the hour on ESPN2. We'll be touching on a lot of games, but y'all know what <at>RealSkipBayless is hot for!"
"Damn!!!"
"<at>Smooveguy617 That was Skip, sir!"
"<at>coacheaddy You know it was! 100 pts in 2 Games to AFC-East teams. Enough said!"
"TONY OH-NO!!!! Pathetic! Cowboys are just sorry tonight. Like I keep telling <at>RealSkipBayless, accident waiting to happen."
"JESUS!!!!!!!!!!! Romo has 5 Interceptions. I wonder what <at>RealSkipBayless is gonna say tomorrow!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>Precise_Cutz Nope. I believe in that ""D"" though."
"<at>GiffyDaGod Please. The only one clueless is someone like you who thinks this is actually a good team!"
"<at>giantsfan719 He's the backup now. He was 4th string in Denver."
"My pleasure!"
"<at>atra1n haaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Uh oh! <at>RealSkipBayless has got a lot of stuff on his mind. And it's not regarding <at>TimTebow. Kobe, watch out! First Take's coming right now"
"<at>GLstat Go ahead and Hate, my brother. It's what makes the world go round!"
"<at>DA154life Read his rap sheet then come talk to me!"
"Sorry, <at>followMyNutz. Then that means you sound like a criminal. I didn't dog that brother. I pointed out a record that spans 8 yrs."
"<at>teeybrown I gave you facts. You're giving me emotion!"
"<at>dejonketchup I did no such thing."
"<at>Narweezo I didn't. I specifically said I didn't know. Not my point. Don't confuse issue."
"<at>KELLIANTHONY Amen!"
"<at>joecavan Thank you."
"<at>TeamLundberg Thank you so much, sweety!"
"I gave FACTS, <at>TerribleTerp27. That's all. I said I wish Brandon Marshall well and hope he's sincere, but we'll see. Nothing wrong with it."
"<at>WarrenMcnulty Necessary!"
"I have a job to do, <at>SoPlugged. I was asked a question; I answered it. You want lies? A phony? Turn the channel. I speak truth to power!"
"<at>RevNunnWisdom My life is under a microscope. I just know better than broadcasting my business or breaking the law!"
"<at>TREEFARMS Thank you!"
"<at>MikeWehner Thank you for watching!"
"<at>AYE_RodneyJ Haaa! Haaa!"
"Absolutely not, <at>therealJgoss. Totally was NOT talking about Iverson. If anything, he's the one who refused to do that!"
"<at>beejai2k Thanks!"
"<at>thekarlfam Thank You!"
"<at>SoPlugged I do what I do. I'm not stopping. Period. Get over it."
"<at>Random_Topher No you don't! :-)"
"<at>TylerJAllen Not true. Dude is still playing in the league!"
"<at>Elvis2Shots Nope!"
"<at>DocksNdaBuildn Amen!"
"False! <at>Roll_1_Smoke_1"
"<at>ThaMaineEvent They do it all the time!"
"<at>GlueKiss Possibly!"
"No true, <at>Prioritymc. I was asked a question, looked up the facts and gave my answer. You don't watch to ask me to lie. Fair. Impartial."
"For those who didn't see today's FIRST TAKE - or still wondering what I said about Brandon Marshall -- here ya go:"

"What is Mike Tannenbaum doing: http://t.co/rljkqScu. I certainly don't know."
"Wow, <at>FontaneJackson. He's beating up on who??? I'm so impressed. SHAAA-LOOOP!!!"
"I'll make sure I'm man enough by not wasting my time acknowledging you after this tweet, <at>lmautism. That should work for you."
"That -- RIGHT THERE -- is why CC Sabathia is Big-Time. Surrender's 8th inn double with No Outs, then shuts down the side. BIG-TIME!"
"YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! Russell Martin in the house. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"I'm not wasting my time getting into a suit battle with anyone. Especially <at>RobParkerESPN."
"Huh?"
"Don't know what he's saying, and don't care, <at>Selli39. I'll never mess with Comedians. He'll kill me. I'm not that stupid :-)"

"What a comeback by the Broncos. Peyton was sensational. So was Elvis Dumervil. But once again, Philip Rivers imitates Tony Romo: finding a"
"Way to mess up on the biggest stage. Chargers just seem like they'll always be a disappointment with Norv Turner."
"Bottom line: No need to be critical of anyone else. Just gotta pay homage to Manning and the Broncos. Big-time comeback. Manning looked good"
"Damn Good!"
"FIRST TAKE in the house!"
"<at>FillUpBanks856 Then what would that make you?"

"<at>NosTra_Damus_ $i had no idea what he was talking about. I've never smoked pot."
"Damn good run by Luck just now. Like I said, the boy is impressive. He can play. Colts made right move by moving on from Peyton Manning."
"<at>ClevelandBus What would I have to do with that? And who the hell do you think you're talking to?"
"<at>GlossnPumps813 Yes, I am."
"<at>superflysnucka Why when the ladies are not complaining :-)"
"<at>jtaylor2025 Both!"
"<at>RealBCarter You need to, because it's true!"
"<at>dickmorris I respect you, sir! But you were wrong on this. So was Karl Rove. Flagrantly so. Let it go! America has spoken."
"<at>VikingBubba Okay Mother Theresa!"
"<at>dickmorris Never said you should. Just that Morris, Rove and the crew were wrong in their projections."
"<at>Senyahawkins I actually would prefer that."
"Will be on Sportscenter in a little bit to discuss Mike Brown's firing."
"<at>buster_555 Wait! We don't work for you. Be patient like everyone else."
"<at>unstopable98 My man, watch another ESPN show. I won't miss you!"
"<at>MrJesusV Don't they always :-)"
"<at>KellzC5 hey You!"
"Lovely! And you?"
"<at>jayjay2318 My man, that is a woman who helped my Mom when hospitalized. Know you what you're talking about or mind your business."
"<at>KellzC5 nosey ppl. Let'em think what they want!"
"<at>jayjay2318 might be because I have nothing to hide."
"You'll have to explain what that means one day!"
"<at>OklahomaWodie Wrong. Consider yourself corrected."
"1 week into NBA season and my assessment hasn't changed: Heat still team to beat. OKC will be best in the West. And watch out for Clippers."
"But Spurs and Grizzlies will be around in West. Boston and Knicks will be around in East. Nets, Sixers? We'll see. We'll see."
"Btw.....MELO will be in the MVP conversation this year. Mark my words."
"Here's all I'm going to say: You pick D'Antoni as next coach for Lakers if you want to entertain for 82 gms. You pick PJ to win titles."
"<at>NTHendo9 With my Birth Certificate."
"Coming on Sportscenter LIVE right now and again at 12:30pm EST. Buckle Up!"
"<at>Ludacris We won't, little Brother :-)"
"<at>HoopsCoachBMS Nope!"
"<at>KingPaggi23 You should be drug tested!"
"<at>walteryanks23 Watch all the games on the internet, my man! And be safe."
"<at>Speaker_CityCFO I don't do highlight reels. If you knew what you were talking about, you wouldn't say such things!"
"<at>stephjonesinCA Nope! I work for sensible, objective fair-minded people. Not people who hate and enjoy doing so."
"Giving respect where it's due, I'm very impressed with what I've seen from aTm vs. Alabama thus far. Very impressed."
"<at>Speaker_CityCFO Legs is the X-and-O guy. I'm the bottom line dude. I understand that makes you jealous, but you're bigger than that."
"<at>itismadhan It's absolutely totally true. He just has no choice now b/c of what he's done to the team. I've been correct. I am now. Period!"
"<at>SoCal49er Nope!"
"<at>bronxfanatic yes, until the playoffs."
"<at>TheeRobMac Not me. Not my job any longer. I'm a radio and TV host. Let the other peeps chase stories. My 16-year run of doing that is over."
"<at>PayUrBrentOnTme Hell No!"
"I really don't understand why Manziel is throwing to nothing but WIDE OPEN RECEIVERS. Where is Alabama's defense. Does not look good!"
"But let's be clear: Manziel is looking like Tom Brady right now with all these short crisp passes."
"ROOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL TIDE!!!"
"Johnny Football played a great game. Very impressive. He's a strong candidate for the Heisman. Nothing but respect. I WAS WRONG on this one."
"<at>Luis_Matos23 Thank You!"
"<at>LarrySpeights You're right. And so was <at>RealSkipBayless. I was wrong. Period."
"<at>griz0310 Dude. Stop being an idiot. If someone paid you to answer questions, that's what you would do. Stop fronting!"
"<at>TheShowSoFly Will never coach. Pres. Of B-Ball Operations? Now that's my cup of tea."
"<at>SportsManRadio No! He looks like ME. I'm 15 years older than him. Get it straight :-)"
"<at>CoachDWMarshall Yes, he did."
"<at>Marvelouz75 They'll manage."
"<at>djladiesmancain Not this season. Because I still don't think they get past OKC. But I reserve the right to change my mind by end of season."
"<at>_TRUEvirgo_ Don't be disrespectful."
"<at>jcnut07 Not worried about them at all. They inspire me."
"<at>lebert77 That was because of LBJ, not the rest of us."
"<at>UCOULDBENEXT Drug Tested exist in all 50 states."
"<at>TeamMexico_ You're on CRACK!!!"
"<at>DaryLeach We disagree. I don't believe that to be true!"
"Here's what I'm ticked off about already: Vick is out w/ a concussion and suddenly with Foles in, the Eagles' off line is blocking suddenly."
"I mean, What The Hell??? Haven't Eagles' fans been asking them to do this all season long."
"So much for all that talk about the Nick Foles starting in place of Vick. What a disaster."
"Btw......can we officially close this book of a season on the NY Jets? Their defense scored their ONLY point. Their offense did squat. Sad!"
"For those who did not see FIRST TAKE today, check it out: http://t.co/AVG7EZrH"
"Why bother asking?"
"<at>MichaelLeoMusic I've done too many interviews to know what you're talking about!"
"<at>Petey1017 Good! Hope you enjoy it."
"<at>DukeBlue007 Stop it!"
"<at>GrnEyedGoddess_ He misses you, too:-)"
"<at>AudiAndrew10 Ummm, do I look like Rob Parker? Get your eyes checked."
"<at>TheonlyYoungE Thank You!"
"<at>AirForceLiggs No sir! You heard me say eventually they would be if Amar'e doesn't return, along with Shumpert. Get it right!"
"For those who didn't see my column on D'Antoni and the Lakers, here ya go: http://t.co/9GwSEPi0"
"About to come on Sportscenter in 5 minutes. Live from LA."
"On another note, very sad day in the B-Ball world. We lost a special man in Kenny ""Eggman"" Williamson, who lost his battle w/ Cancer."
"Dear, dear friend of Williamson put it best: He wasn't a luminary, but he was BASKETBALL ROYALTY. Wonderful to everyone who knew him. Shame!"
"#NBAGAMETIME Blatche had a nice move there. Hopefully, it'll continue. He comes the play and the Nets are significantly better. We'll see."
"#NBAGAMETIME Melo is still flowing. Forget his pts. He's shooting 8-for-14 from the field. This is the kind of efficiency we need from him."
"#NBAGAMETIME For the record, I'm in LA, about to witness the Lakers -- pre D'Antoni. Hopefully, tonight's not last time I see them play ""D"""
"#NBAGAMETIME Btw....Felton's 15 points are nice, but I want to see more than 2 assists. Who the hell does he think he is? Jeremy Lin (haaa)"
"#NBAGAMETIME And I'm not happy at all that NY is tied with Orlando. They should be running over this team. But I'll be patient."
"Actually, I don't!"
"#NBAGAMETIME See, here's my thing on JR: I know he's lethal. Problem? Sometimes it's against the opponent. Other times it's against own team"
"We can definitely meet up before I leave on Friday, Jake."
"Do you have any idea who you're talking about, <at>georgemallet? MonteRoss is my college teammate and one of my best friends in the world."
"<at>CardsByHarris <at>ESPN_FirstTake I'm saying play him or don't play him. But don't misuse him this way. It's embarrassing and unnecessary."
"<at>CheyenneTweets Save your emotions for your spouse/partner. I call things like I see them. If I believed in the Knicks, I would say so."
"<at>CraigT9 Yes I was."
"<at>AA15rifle Get over it. The man can't throw. Only said it a million times. But to do him like that anonymously, that's low-class. Too much."
"Who gives a damn, <at>Raidermike63. The man can't throw. But he doesn't deserve the weak, pathetic Jets talking about him like that. Wrong!"
"Thank you, <at>SturdyShow. That is PRECISELY what I'm saying."
"<at>Malachi_Light The Jaguars swear they didn't want him. Only that their new owner asked them to consider it, but it was the coaches choice."
"<at>Bre_Rice <at>RealSkipBayless They deserve it."
"<at>ChadBrisben All of the above."
"<at>Andrew316Reece <at>RyanRuocco Puh-leeze."
"<at>Z_Barnes93 I don't contradict myself. You just don't listen."
"I was waiting for my radio show with <at>RyanRuocco to get into all of these anonymous sources running their mouths about <at>timtebow. Buckle up!"
"<at>Unfairfight Huh?"
"<at>BillyPunch Agreed :-)"
"<at>catchit16 Haaaaa!!!!!!!"
"<at>cyoungconsults Because that's not how it went down!"
"<at>TheDarkBlizzard Haaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>BillyPunch Thanks Bro!"
"I'm here at the Clips/Heat Game. Let me tell y'all something: <at>KingJames is using post moves on Blake Griffin. EFFECTIVELY. That is trouble."
"By that I mean..if <at>KingJames gets to a pt where his post game is like THAT, it's over for the entire NBA. And I do mean over!"
"Also....Jamal Crawford just boogied on Ray Allen. 7-quick points off the bench. Instant offense. If on, he's a difference maker."
"Buckle up! FIRST TAKE is coming at you on ESPN2 right now. Yes, we'll touch on Tebow, but stay w/ me. Certain things need to be said.Finally"
"<at>CONCIERGE_AUX01 <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>RealSkipBayless We'll get to that. Trust me. I was at the Clippers game last night vs. Miami."
"With profound respect, <at>pr3achpreacha, I believe that it totally untrue. What ppl say is that he can't throw. He's given chances bestowed"
"upon no one else, <at>pr3achpreacha. That is just a fact. One can love the lord and appreciate who <at>TimTebow is and still say that. Sorry!"
"<at>iamshultz You're not getting rid of that contract right now."
"Haaaaaaaa, <at>realcormega. Thank you."
"No doubt! Holla at me when you get a chance!"
"Pul-leeze, <at>IAMBENZINO. Now YOU need to be drug tested!"
"<at>MadDogRadio Not even a little bit."
"<at>LeungMMAdh He's not against me. He's my Radio partner. We agree on a lot of things. This is not FIRST TAKE."
"<at>THEBASEDMARTYR Thank you!"
"<at>sherman2024 yes sir."
"<at>ChillinAssPete Thank You!"
"<at>gerard32 I try."
"<at>MCSuave I agree."
"<at>JohnnyStash69 When I lose my first one I'll let you know."
"<at>shwjas You're talking to the wrong person."
"<at>PhiIJackson haaaaa. Love that."
"<at>erik_hogan if you say so."
"<at>PurpleandGold32 liar. Coach would never say that about me."
"<at>JBellaP30 my pleasure."
"<at>az_deuce evidently you do."
"<at>Niggarachii_ I suggest you grow the hell up if you ever want a tweet from me again. Giving someone their just due isn't doing what you said"
"<at>cubecroat It's a free country, bro. If you have a job, you know you can't dictate what your co-workers choose to do. Live with it."
"<at>JayJaysmoove18 I've got made respect for the Grizz. Fan of former owner, Heisley. But I don't think they have athletic horses in the end."
"<at>DiDDy915 You wish!"
"<at>johnadeleon You're definitely smoking crack. You should be placed in  rehab immediately."
"<at>RowdyPhi1114 Let'em keep hating. Everyone needs a source of inspiration. All the Haters are mine."
"<at>OmarUtsa15 Maybe because your brain is moving slowly."
"#NBAGAMETIME Come on Knicks. Way to come back."
"#NBAGAMETIME Yeah, Yeah, Felton. Way to ball, baby. Very proud of my Knicks right now."
"#NBAGAMETIME And I don't know about anybody else, but I love the fact that Melo has just 9 pts thus far and the Knicks are still in this."
"#NBAGAMETIME Yeahhhhhh J.R. Yeaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!"
"#NBAGAMETIME Keep D-ing up Knicks. Keep D-ing up."
"#NBAGAMETIME Haaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Kidd still has it in  him. Go NY, Go NY, Goooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"#NBAGAMETIME Big-time win by the Knicks. I'm impressed. Good night for Knicks' fans."
"BUCKLE UP! It's time for FIRST TAKE on ESPN2. We'll be talking basketball and football. Hopefully, no Tebow :-)"
"<at>stocktonisdaman Damnit!"
"<at>WINTER_BOWLES You're the idiot for thinking the coach doesn't influence such things."
"For those who didn't see today's FIRST TAKE: http://t.co/AVG7EZrH."
"Just in case none of you saw my latest column, here ya go: http://t.co/0jpZ9uaJ"
"<at>TreysDay_ Good luck, Bro!"
"<at>JamesKep_the1st Evidently, you would know."
"<at>RobDeininger absolutely."
"<at>almalik64 I'm already proud of him."
"FIRST TAKE in the house on ESPN2 right now. Buckle Up!!!"
"<at>AlessandraBruzi 1969."
"<at>C_Banis711 Nope! Buffalo is going broke. Not worth it."
"Yours Truly with <at>RyanRuocco coming right now on ESPN Radio New York (98.7FM). Holla at ya boys!"
"<at>Relbow79 Ya Think!"
"<at>glynch77 Always!"
"<at>kylebugg87 It's an OPINION. Journalism is about researching FACTS, not filtering opinions. I said what I feel and meant it. Grow up!"
"<at>Mista_Mixon Impressive. Like the kid."
"<at>alloydesq Thank ya baby! I aim to please."
"Haaaaa!!!!!"
"<at>Aill_617 My man, I only care about what WOMEN have to say about my looks!"
"<at>lolawhodat Yes she did. But Monique's my baby, so it was all good!"
"<at>Switchin_Laness Get the wax out of your ears, or get glasses to read correctly. That's exactly what I've been saying."
"<at>DylanDiCarlo I damn-sure try!"
"<at>mattvazin You got that right!"
"<at>250bhb No!"
"<at>Real_hP Always!"
"<at>diceman4192 Legit contenders. I'm dead serious about that."
"<at>presidentherps did no such thing. I agree with that!"
"<at>Sosa_RFBPReZ Because the Nets are not my priority. The Knicks are."
"<at>Knight_Time00 Haaaaa! Did you call ME a virgin? Now that's a first. There's hope for me afterall."
"<at>RyanRuocco I think the Nets are gonna get crushed!"
"<at>COOL_C81 How am I jumping off the bandwagon just because I picked them to lose tonight? Who the hell ever said they're going 82-0? Idiot!"
"Like I told y'all, Melo will be an MVP Candidate for the Knicks. If they continue to win. The dude is unstoppable when he's on."
"But the Knicks still need more. Very happy with their record, but perspective is needed. Big-time wins over Mia and SA, but look at big pic:"
"Impressive. Rooting for them. Not trying to rain on parade. God Knows NY has waited long enough. But everything's falling their way for now."
"Let's keep our eyes out for what ensues. Time will tell. And so will stiffer competition."
"<at>RyanRuocco True. I'm watching and liking what I'm seeing. Williams will need to match Kobe's aggression tonight."
"I know one thing: Orlando looks straight stupid for not working out a deal for Brook Lopez. He's not D-Howard but the man can play off."
"<at>ESPN_FirstTake Stop trippin. Kobe did that to Phil. Relax."
"<at>Erockalypse Not true!"
"Very impressed with the Nets right now. Hope it lasts."
"FIRST TAKE is in the house. ESPN2. Right now."
"Yes Sir. Martin! My all-time favorite."
"Sure, <at>coledaddy_22. Just go to school, get ur education and spend 20 yrs establishing your credentials in this biz, and we'll have ya on."
"<at>JocksNbeats Don't be ridiculous."
"<at>Marvin_8_her Who cares!"
"<at>Pollydore23 Thank you so much!"
"<at>Stoney_Grant12 Look at FIRST TAKE. Don't ask me to repeat myself."
"What a game b/t Clips/Thunder. Westbrook big-time with 2 J's, but decision-making still questionable. CP3 just off 2nite. D'Jordan big-time"
"Post move. Matt Barnes showed up, too. But Durant is the man. Still needs to be more aggressive."
"Here's the thing: Del Negro has got to get something going other than Pick-and-Roll. Just has to be more versatile as a coach. It's in him."
"Bogus foul call on CP3 on Durant. Let'em play."
"And btw.....Hubie Brown is absolutely right: Blake Griffin is not only NOT scoring. He can't even get touches. OKC is D'ing up."
"<at>44TheLegend Cats like you ain't in the league anymore, bro! ""Tuff"" has a new definition now that you, Oak, Mahorn and crew are gone :-)"
"I think the Knicks are gonna come back at win this. Mavs 3-straight blunders: giving up 3, 3-pt play and commiting reach-in foul after miss."
"Let's Go Knicks!!!!"
"Haaaa!!! Kaman just missed open layup"
"Bull<at>#*+<at>! Melo got mugged on that shot. No Call by refs. But Collison missed. Now Melo's gonna pay them back with a game-winner. Watch!"
"Damn! Mad props to the Matrix, Shawn Marion, on defense. Made Melo missed, plus Melo fouls out on miss. Damn! Damn! Damn!"
"I'll be on Sportscenter at the top of the hour...discussing the coach from Morehead State. You've seen the video? You know what's coming!"
"But don't miss <at>RealSkipBayless and myself on 1st Take this morning. 10AM, Eastern Time on ESPN2. We'll really get into it then. But nicely!"
"Happy Thanksgiving everyone. FIRST TAKE still in the house on ESPN2. RRIIIGGGGHHHTTTTT NOW!"
"I'm so Thankful for my Mom's Health, along with the tremendous love I receive from family and friends. Wishing all of you a Happy One Today."
"I'm done with Schaub. I've believed in him enough. Totally done with him."
"See, here's what is gonna tick me off: These Redskins'  receivers dropping passes."
"<at>ElleMocha Speak it, Girl! Speak it."
"I tried to tell y'all about them Cowboys. What a waste. Get Garrett out of there. At least you'll know you're moving in a right direction."
"I knew the Jets would get blown out....EVENTUALLY. What I never imagined is that they've be this God-Awful. What a freakin' disgrace!"
"I knew the Jets would get blown out, but not like this. This is a complete annihilation. Warranting change. Season is over. Thank God!"
"<at>skinsgohard How the hell is a 77-yd hookup from Manning to Cruz a BS play? You sound ignorant."
"<at>thefishuation Are you even out of diapers yet. Shallop!"
"<at>ShutUpEmilio Then I suspect you know enough to know that the Lakers are not your typical Lakers."
"<at>wisejohnp Lies!"
"<at>RyJ613 And that's why the Rockets aren't that good. Because they have fans like you who are too soft."
"<at>OldMetJohn I'm actually very happy. Perhaps YOU'RE the one who's angry because you don't want me to be Happy!"
"<at>RyJ613 Solid, sure. But that's all."
"<at>PaigonBudd Email the show."
"<at>shortyblack509 36 Years and counting!"
"I'm sick and damn tired of folks hiding behind tweets. I'm doing Radio in NY on 98.7FM today by myself. Feel free to call in: 800.919.3776."
"You can go online at http://t.co/JiR5e6Fa and click on live for Radio. I'm right here. Bring it!"
"I've got 2 Hours of unfiltered airwaves available to me on ESPN New York (98.7FM) right now. Call 800.919.3776. Look out Jets! I'm coming!"
"<at>WilliamGreen20 Thank You!"
"<at>TheRealBrahim Yes Sir!"
"<at>wilkensjeune Stay disappointed. Anybody who thinks Woods' action was NOT inappropriate is playing Race Card. He was out of control. Period."
"<at>jeff_cohen_ where have you been. It's all over Youtube!"
"<at>ThatBayGirl Thank you dear!"
"<at>KimberleyLocke That's the way to go, Girl. Dexter S6 is real good, so far. Love that show."
"<at>Sweet_Mela Thank you sweety!"
"<at>NeoFlight25 Please do. And thanks for the support."
"<at>ThatBayGirl Good. Because I definitely love the Bay!"
"<at>GOOCHAVELI Seasons 3 thru 5."
"<at>wilkensjeune Pay attention the times. Wake up. Your emotions won't accomplish a damn thing!"
"I simply cannot believe that the Knicks picked the night they're facing Jeremy Lin to stink up the joint. I'm so ashamed of them right now!"
"<at>JGeewentworth Nasty!"
"<at>TheReal_DJM Yes it is!"
"<at>ASmithTraining Didn't see it today!"
"<at>QNC2 Huh? What did SNL do now???"
"<at>1BiggDonnVonn Thank you so much!"
"<at>SkipHater1 Actually, I was 3-for-3 on Thanksgiving Day ole' Ignorant one!"

"FIRST TAKE in the house, y'all. Football Monday. Buckle up. ESPN2...coming at ya right now!!!!"
"<at>danajacobson Congrats, my dear. Very well deserved. Miss ya. Wishing y'all all the best."
"<at>roswell2001 Awwwww! So emotional!"
"BETRAYAL! Benedict Arnold's all over the place!"
"<at>iLoveMyN3rd Stop laughing at me, Girl!"
"<at>KillCaliLuv shame on you for having a problem with it!"
"<at>WiggityWiggitY You first!"
"<at>JorgeRossello evidently not!"
"<at>tajmalik I'm not talking about the team. I was talking about the fans."
"FIRST TAKE RIGHT NOW!!!!"
"Just in case you're dismissing the possibility of the Nets competing with the Knicks, check out my column: http://t.co/8nowlIVA"
"Thanks Magic man, <at>MagicJohnson. Always appreciate the love!"
"Right now, I'm loving what I'm seeing from Crean's boys at Indiana. They're blowing UNC out of the building. <at>DwyaneWade must be excited."
"<at>30bjones He did. But Crean was his coach there before leaving for Indiana."
"People, <at>DwyaneWade would be happy because Crean is his former coach at Marquette. I really wonder about some of you folks sometimes!"
"<at>ChitownStu You're very welcome!"
"FIRST TAKE in the house on ESPN2 until 12 Noon (EST). Tune in. Lots of interesting topics coming up!"
"<at>mauricefieldman You're ignorance is shining thru. Strictly because you assume I'm rich, which is totally false. And to call out Bill Cosby?"
"<at>mauricefieldman You have no idea how ignorant you sound. Your not liking something he says doesn't negate the MILLIONS he's poured into our"
"<at>mauricefieldman community. You should be ashamed of yourself for evening thinking to speak of Bill Cosby negatively."
"<at>iAm_Thill No problem!"
"<at>LucaBrasi718 Thank You!"
"<at>ledoux264 My pleasure, bro!"
"<at>paattyyggg Thank you!"
"<at>xMouthpiece23 Not hating. Just stating facts!"

"<at>niquefranklin That's good to hear young brother. Keep it coming!"
"<at>XavierBright17 Thanks!"
"<at>MrBruceLeroy Thanks!"
"<at>PHE_E16 first of all, we're talking about some. Not most! Not all. And secondly, you know better!"
"<at>Nationwidemik3 I try to be."
"If Ralph Wiley was alive, <at>KL_0113, I'd gladly move aside for him. One of the greatest ever. Sorely missed. Loved/respected My friend!"
"<at>rkarnib4nyk No!"

"<at>kirbyecoley Thank You!"
"<at>DeeWest175 yes sir!"
"<at>Viva_La_Knicks I said he's a star. But Superstars don't get bounced out in the 1st Round 8 times in 9 years. Melo's my MVP right now, tho!"

"For those who did not see today's FIRST TAKE, here ya go: http://t.co/AVG7EZrH"
"<at>Reloadednow don't you wish you were? :-)"
"<at>Gods_Child903 Thanks Bro! Appreciate the love."
"<at>GioPontiFan Even worse to recognize that after all I explained, that's what you took from it. Very sad!"
"<at>Sports_RealTalk Totally agree. But when has that stopped folks from judging?"
"<at>TR_JoeFrazier Not All, but unfortunately MOST. You and I both know it."
"<at>Collo_Drolo Amen, Bruh!"
"<at>virgilpete No problem, Bruh!"
"Didn't miss the opportunity, <at>hollyrpeete. We all know stereotypes are wrong, but it exists. We can't progress by avoiding the reality that"
"That ppl are entitled to their perceptions, <at>hollyrpeete. Employers care about presentation. It's inescapable. Love ya dearly, Mrs. Peete."
"Folks, y'all are more than welcomed to call into my Radio show with <at>RyanRuocco on ESPN NY (98.7FM). 8000.919.3776 is the call-in #."
"I'm here. Nobody's running!"
"<at>aldebaran422 thanks."
"<at>MadSetter thank you."
"<at>joeyheinrich Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!"
"After the Tide Rolled -- as I said they would -- I decided to watch B'Klyn vs. Miami. Y'all need to watch these Nets. Good decision-making."
"The Nets are moving the ball well, Hitting perimeter shots, being unselfish. And they haven't even learned to play together yet. Look out NY"
"<at>VisionDriver You'll see me on Monday. I'll deal with him then!"
"I'll tell ya something else: <at>DwyaneWade is looking special right now. Nets can't post or create anything in penetration. Off has shut down."
"After shooting 50 percent or better in each of first 3 qt's, B'klyn shot 14 percent in the 4th QT. Disgraceful. J. Johnson has to help out."
"He's too good to be playing the way he's playing. Deron Williams needs his help. Other dudes are limited. Not those 2. JJ has to do better."
"<at>AM3RICANCentaur Thank you for the inspiration. Btw....you have GREAT taste!"
"<at>JadrankoS_Bato We'll see."
"<at>CJSWAG101 Deron Williams will be fine! Don't worry about him!"

"Ladies and Gentlemen, Raymond Felton is putting on a show. I can't believe what I'm seeing from the Knicks right now. Hope it lasts!"
"Spoelstra went with M. Miller and R. Allen in and it didn't work. Then he inserted Norris Cole. Got quickness in an off and def. Difference!"
"Knicks are not getting open shots now. Mia has amped up defensive pressure. Now Knicks are trying to go 1-on-1. Won't work. Kidd and Felton"
"Need to save day. They'll need to get the ball moving again. Knicks had an 18-pt lead. Even w/o Melo, we're about to find out a little about"
"Them."

"Perhaps I need to re-think my position is this happens again."
"I'm an honorable man, so I must admit <at>realskipbayless is right-on with that. He IS the one who told me about Manziel."
"<at>kurtbruckner how would you know if you weren't listening to them, fool!"

"I just can't bring myself to do pay-per-view. But I do love Pacquaio/Marquez. But I just can't do it. I HAVE MY PRIDE :-)"
"OMG! What a KNOCKOUT. Paqman....out on his FACE. What do you have to say now <at>RealSkipBayless. What do you have to say now???"
"Who the hell said I did not see the fight. Are y'all crazy. What I said was....I refused to PAY for it. That's all. I saw Pacman on his FACE"
"Ravens def. should be ashamed of themselves. I don't care what anyone says. They were given an 8-pt lead and RGIII went down. Enough said."

"<at>djmaxime_monroe I will if they beat the 49ers next week."
"it's absolutely fitting that the Jets lost the game this way. Stupid INT by Sanchez. Botched shotgun snap b/t an experienced center and QB."

"I'll respond to all of this on Manti Te'o right now on ESPN Radio (98.7FM) in New York right now!!!!!"
"Enough of this nonsense. Let me make myself very clear once and for all on this Manti Te'o stuff. Listen up. I'll only say it once:"
"Whether Te'o was duped or not is irrelevant to me. The question is: did the kid dupe then nation is saying the things he said about her?"
"He claimed they were soulmates once they connected eye-to-eye, implying the actually met one another. He spoke glowingly of a love affair"
".....Although, as we've now learned, they never met one another."
"She got into a car accident; he never went to see her. She was diagnosed with Leukemia; he never went to see her. She obviously received"
"Treatment; he never went to see her. She DIED; he never went to see her. In between, they spent 4-to-8 hours at a time on the phone"
"......Despite the fact that he's a student-athlete, with classes and football practice and supposedly in no position to afford such bills."
"So, in the end, it doesn't matter who concocted the scheme or when. All that matters is that Te'o ultimately told knew and conveyed PUBLICLY"
"What he conveyed. It's JUST MY OPINION, but I don't see how he was totally hoodwinked over the course of 3 years. Not buying it!"
"<at>colbygibbs47 haaaaaaaaa!!!!!!"
"I don't give a damn about his personal life, <at>KalaBabu08. I care about addressing news, which is what he made himself into. Deal with it!"
"Are you confused, <at>mc_shan_520. I've been a journalist for 20 yrs, as well as being paid to give my opinion. That's what I did."
"And let's be clear, <at>mc_shan_520. My feelings/opinion hasn't changed one bit. NOT ONE SINGLE BIT. But feel free to believe what you want."
"I'm moving on, <at>mc_shan_520. I've seen this story before. Y'all believe what you want. Quite honestly, I hope we all leave him be to live"

"I'm done talking Te'o. God Bless him. He's a kid, no matter what I believe happened. I've got NFL on my mind. Can't wait for games tomorrow."
"One thing I'll say about this Crabtree situation: it doesn't help the 49ers to have to deal with this right now."
"Feeling is mutual, <at>DellisTheAhole. Make sure the house is packed!"
"Just wanted to let the State of Texas know I'm very excited. Looking forward to speaking at Texas AM tonight. Just can't wait! Lots 2 Say!"

"Watching College B-Ball (Michigan/Minnesota) right now. Love Hardaway and Burke together. Hope Michigan can keep it up."

"Thanks, <at>AndrewBezjian. Jackie's absolutely sensational. Pls give her my best. Melo's #2 in line right now behind Durant in my book."
"Thanks the point you fool, <at>joshua_frith. You don't know and never will b/c I wasn't that damn sloppy."
"<at>BlastFace I'll work on it :-)"
"An even sadder day when you're lost and ignorant enough to think such a thing, <at>rodneymc2, or even bother to compare the 2 things."
"I can't wait either, <at>RalphBHoopin. Hope y'all are hyped and ready for me, because I certainly am."
"My man, <at>TeamLou23. Sorry to hear you're out bro. Get better. Keep ya head up!"
"<at>Skywalka21 Stoppppppp!!!!! No need for that."
"As SHAMEFULLY NON-EXISTENT as Atlanta's defense has been since the 1st QT, this is on Matt Ryan. He's got to find a way after that screw-up."
"You simply don't make an unforced error like that, especially when you notice how difficult it is for you defense to stop the 49ers. Let's C"

"No doubt!!!"
"<at>Swaim55 Haaaaaa!!!!!!!"
"<at>staceyfett Critics all over the country keep bringing up his past....as a way of calling him a hypocrite because of all his talk. All I'm"
"Saying, <at>staceyfett, is that he should be careful because he won't want that as a storyline to end his career."
"<at>ozziebearHass I suppose we should listen to YOU!"
"No, <at>VipertheIV. I saying there are players who actually feel that way!"
"<at>brianiskool nope. Not with those receivers getting softened up!"
"You know what, anybody who has a problem on my Te'o position can go KICK ROCKS! Don't give me some damn nonsense about ""Catfish!"" We're not"
"Talking about something that spanned 3 weeks. It spanned 3 years. 3-damn-years. Y'all believe what you want and I'll do the same. But......"

"Yep, <at>KyleMcCLay. Unless Kobe goes berserk. And I meant every word I said."

"Not true at all, <at>Wokda. When it comes to FIRST TAKE, <at>RealSkipBayless and I are 50/50. We Ride Together/We Die Together. Bad Boys 4 Life!"
"How does that ques apply, <at>dwight_burn! It would still be a man we're talking about. #Idiot!"
"FIRST TAKE RIGHT NOW. Buckle up!"
"<at>brash03 Actually, he is :-)"
"<at>carsonaeberhard The Ques about GB/Sea was whether it was the right call or not. Kan/IS ques was about what should happen to officials!"

"<at>titobarksdale Thank You!"
"FIRST TAKE in the house. And so am I. Skip's about to trip off <at>KingJames again. But not just him!!!!!"
"I said what I said and I meant what I meant. Regarding our President, I was talking about his intelligence and accomplishments in life - NOT"
"His politics or policies. I respect THE PRESIDENT of our country -- no matter who he is. And as for Rodman, it was an ignorant display."
"Plain and simple. Watch the damn interview. And for those questioning my BLACKNESS, let me be clear: KICK ROCKS! Especially to those who"
"Wouldn't take a stance on any damn thing if it cost them $5 out of their pocket. Get some guts -- and heart -- then come talk to me!"
"FIRST TAKE in the house. The AFTERNOON EDITION. On ESPN. Right now...3:30-4pm EST. Buckle up!"
"Calm down, <at>cjdyer25. I don't pretend to know a damn thing about Hockey. Was just having fun with Barry Melrose. It's not that serious."

"Never heard of them, <at>Landcross. Never!"
"<at>mistermatt1984 You sure about that? :-)"
"They didn't, <at>tal1286. Were just having fun with me and Melrose!"
"<at>FauxPMcGuire Thank You :-)"
"<at>____________37 You talking about me on that first part or yourself?"

"<at>MistrDiaz My man! Thanks!"
"They are straight, <at>_TheRealAdonis. I'm enjoying a successful life. If baldness is the fallout, does it look like I care! :-)"
"<at>Primetime000 I did. But I don't care b/c I'm not the one questioning his skills."
"<at>TrevorHanig because the Heat aren't the ones struggling to make the playoffs."
"<at>LightSkinned_x3 Nope!"
"<at>hashbrown317 We discussed it all. Pay attention to content, not the headline, and you would've noticed!"
"<at>hot_dog_man99 Thank you for noticing!"
"<at>alexgalvan33 Thanks Alex!"

"<at>ArtsnFarts23 We're all entitled to our feelings!"

"Amen, <at>_KPOWERS. Amen Brother!"
"Did you forget who Babe Ruth played against, <at>mattfishsr? Or should I say....DIDN'T play against?"
"<at>bbar3bati I'd feel very sorry for you if you did!"
"I'm about to address this Sherman thing with <at>RealSkipBayless on FIRST TAKE yesterday afternoon RIGHT NOW!!! On Radio (ESPN-NY 98.7FM)."

"<at>shutmouths The RATINGS say otherwise my man :-). Sorry to deliver the bad news!"
"<at>_Fear_No_Man_ I believe I've said from Day 1 that the Lakers would make the playoffs......then lose in the 1st Round. What's the problem?"
"<at>ash32522 Thank You so much!"
"<at>Terellsmith Thank Yyou!"
"I don't have a problem with it, <at>BM2013BM. If I'm wrong, it should be pointed out that I'm wrong. Comes with the job. Bib Boy rules."
"And Btw...although the Celts have completely exceeded my expectations, my comments pertained to them competing for the title. Not Reg season"
"<at>bmmitchell33 Thanks Bro!"
"<at>MarkTarro That's the beauty of what I do: can always roll to the tape with Haters like you!"
"I said what I believed, <at>theflea4L. No regrets. You want someone lying to you about what's in their heart, go watch someone else!"
"Dwight Howard looks strong today, <at>cap801. The healthier he gets, the more potent he'll be."
"Thanks, <at>TommyJamison. Appreciate the love."
"<at>theffb2clean Miami!"
"<at>eMdOt135 They can't. Used amnesty on Chauncey Billups so they could get Candler."
"Attention! Come to my city at 1500 Broadway (44th &amp;Broad) btwn 3pm – 5pm on Mon to be on FIRST TAKE. It's your chance to embrace debate."

"<at>Mayo_44 Lighting, idiot. Not makeup."
"<at>jfresh2deth Not good right now."
"<at>Josh_Tansey 20 years of credentials. Look it up then call me. I'm not running.....from ANYBODY in this business."
"It's true...as much as i hate to admit it. Understand, if Tiago Splitter balls, TD has help on the frontline. Makes the Spurs lethal!"
"<at>PeteJack85 Haaa. Thanks!"
"<at>Bowman_1992 Amen!"
"Okay, it's time. Yours truly with <at>RealMichaelKay, <at>RyanRuocco and my man <at>DonLagreca -- the 4 Horseman -- live on ESPN Radio (98.7FM) NY."

"<at>BrianHCaulfield I have no idea what you're talking about. Seriously!"
"<at>HughesFTW Nope! To me, any game that goes to overtime with no definitive loser is a tie. So what do I know :-)"
"I don't usually get on Kids, but Richmond's Williams foul vs. Clayton was just idiotic. Not smart at all. Ultimately gave Charlotte the game"
"FIRST TAKE in the house at the top of the hour on ESPN2. <at>RealSkipBayless has a huge attitude today. Don't know why. Uh Oh! (Smile!!!!!)"

"<at>bullpenal1963 thanks bro!"
"<at>JewelsBenedict ""Knows a little something"" about offense.....and what he wants. Quote me accurately please!"

"<at>MrCJames308 Not better than Duncan. Stop it!"
"<at>therealBriBoW Okay!"
"<at>Lifetime_Ab Whatever he needs to be.......when he wants to be!"

"<at>knwl_iz_king Huh?"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, Jeff Green is putting on a show. This moment is what Ainge and Doc acquired him from OKC for. #Unbelievablethusfar"
"That should not have been a technical foul on LeBron. But give Celtics credit: Showing a whole lot of heart. Enough to make you believe:"
"If they had everyone healthy, the East wouldn't be as locked up as most of us think it would be."
"Then again, it's only the first half. I'm still expecting the Heat to come back from this."
"I'm about to make a cameo on FIRST TAKE right now.......for 1 segment!"
"Haaaaa! you could possibly get it. But only if I decided on something Bigger and Better was on the Horizon :-)"
"What the hell is going on? Why is this happening to Miami. I refuse to believe -- even now -- that they'll lose this game."
"Not good if <at>KingJames loses in Cleveland. Even if he's off his game........his teammates need to pick him up."
"We're off until Monday, <at>TheBigLEPOWski"

"<at>cureton48141 Yes!"
"<at>cureton48141 Thanks Bro!"
"Puh-leeze, <at>mattstanley10 Nobody twisted a damn thing about <at>DezBryant. I said he can ball. The Cowboys just stink, that's all. #FalseHype!"
"<at>jKisk34 A lot. He's a great young coach!"
"Pay attention <at>FearTheTurtle24. I'll give any member of the Cowboys are hard time. They stink! Damn shame they're called AMERICA'S TEAM!"
"Bye <at>SportsAce214. We won't miss you!"
"He can say something if he wants to, <at>TomSheldon22. Nobody's running from <at>DezBryant. I didn't diss him any different than any other Cowboy"
"They stink, <at>TomSheldon22. Tell <at>DezBryant to call me when the Cowboys make the playoffs and stop getting spanked by NFC Foes <at> season end"
"<at>JulianMckelvey Twisting what?"
"Nope, <at>Stringer_B_. Don't care too either. All I know is 2K yards doesn't equal playoffs. He's been home watching -- like me -- last 2 years"
"<at>GaliEdwards Take what!"
"<at>kevinlogan45 Shallop!"
"<at>KaneBaldwin Yes I do!"
"Spare me, <at>TravisMays33. He's a Cowboy. They twist stuff up all the time by trying to act like America's Team. America: nation of WINNERS"
"<at>ReeF_NYC Puh-leeze!"
"<at>Jeffsmall46 Yes Sir. Thank You!"
"<at>KillaQuis1 Amen!"
"<at>grossdog7328 Dream On!"

"Puh-leeze, <at>schmeb37. We'd at least be in the conference finals, if not fighting for the championship. Shut your damn mouth :-)"
"Oh, I'm so scared  <at>SBozz9SSP. Spare me!"
"Make the damn playoffs, <at>Will_IKeelYou. And I'll shut up. Until then......HOW 'BOUT THEM COWBOYS!"
"And you're a Cowboys lover, <at>mattstanley10 so that makes you God? SHALLOP!"
"I have no question about <at>DezBryant, <at>Jhooks42. He's bigtime. But the Cowboys STINK! Period. Stop twisting things. Make the damn playoffs."
"<at>JassemALSulaiti Thanks Bro!"
"Thank You! Thank You! Thank You, <at>Jason_ESPN. Somebody needed to say that."
"You're America's JOKE, <at>_G_NO. How many playoff appearances/victories have you had in the last 17 Years? Kick rocks with that damn nonsense"
"How old were you at the time of their last one? XCwbyKPX. 2 Years Old?"
"Smack yourself for asking such a dumb question, <at>ILoveMyLife7777"
"<at>TheOneToby Next question!"
"Don't listen then, <at>AndreyA487. Does it sound like I'd miss you?"
"The Cowboys are that Fine-as-Hell woman that keeps saying ""Yes"" to a date and ""No"" to every nightcap, <at>hsouza14. Spending all you $$$.:-)"
"About-damn-Time, <at>Jo215. That's what I'll say!"
"Awwwww, <at>benbenman__. Poor Babies :-)"
"<at>brnb21 Won't happen. But I appreciate the offer :-)"
"<at>GaryLawrence4 So whhat!"
"Lesson: <at>JheriKurlEarl. I spent years accumulating facts to EARN THE RIGHT to express my opinions. 95 percent of industry can't say that!"
"Who gives a damn. Cowboys fans should look at their team then punch themselves for rooting for them!"
"CowboysNation! Relax. I'm just coming at y'all as a NY Fan. I'm going to say y'all stink even when you don't. It just happens to be true ..."
"Just wanted to take a moment to extend my sincere congratulations to brother <at>rolandsmartin for being named Journalist of the year for 2013."
"An incredible honor by the National Association of Black Journalist. Proud of you, Bro!"
"Tell'em I don't give a damn, <at>Terryhandley1. They know my number. Who's hiding? I'll gladly come on ESPN Radio in Dallas to say: THEY SUCK"
"<at>JetJerry2408 All that means is that your misinformed!"
"I call it like I see it, <at>Centaur_. When cats deserve scrutiny, I give it. The same with praise. It's called being a grown-ass man. #Fair!"
"Like I've said, <at>jz1210. If that's an ESPN Station, they know the number. I'm not hard to find!"
"No sir, <at>GiftedAndLifted. Only off that one song!"
"<at>jwillzy Goodbye!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, please know if you can't watch your language on my page you will be blocked. Don't make me tell y'all again!"
"The Astros payroll is $25 mil, <at>gnofinder. A-Rod gets paid more than their entire roster this season. Where's the commitment to winning?"
"Didn't hear, <at>Pete5keet5keet. Would always say hello when spoken too."
"You either don't know what the hell ur talking about, can't see or hear, or don't have Tivo/DVR, <at>ralphlopez41. I've address that many xxx."
"<at>paulgordoncast good!"
"<at>FINO09 I agree with that!"
"<at>Ferdyvs_28 Roy was Great until he ran into Tarver and Glen Johnson."
"<at>MrJayCusto I said he's a nice guy who's never said a bad word about anybody in all the years I've known him. That's all."
"It was not the fight of the century, <at>DanielGross_CO."
"<at>TylerPaschall Can't watch it again! Just can't!"
"<at>Hizzsterr Don't like it. Will discuss tomorrow."
"Remember Folks: FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 will be LIVE from TIMES SQUARE, NYC  tomorrow in front of a STUDIO AUDIENCE. Buckle up. Here we come!"
"The spot is the Hard Rock Cafe! All are welcomed, so long as ya act like you have some damn sense :-)."
"Watch First Take tomorrow. I'll save my fury for then. On a multitude of issues!"
"Thriller-in-Manila (Ali vs. Frazier), enternetpimpin. How 'bout Holyfield/Bowe I. Or Gatti/Ward."
"Big-Time win for the Heat/Bosh. Happy he got the chance to remind everyone the Heat are not all <at>KingJames and <at>DwyaneWade. Way da go!"
"First Take is in the house LIVE, not just on ESPN2....but LIVE in Times Square (NYC) at the Hard Rock Cafe. We're hyped. Bring the NOISE!"
"For those who didn't catch today's edition of FIRST TAKE in front of a live studio audience at Hard Rock Cafe in NYC: http://t.co/C6ApJsc2Ex"
"<at>mark212149ers Enjoy!"

"<at>Mray20 :-):-):-)"
"<at>Zach_Shhhmith The likelihood is that I'm happier than you. Is it possible you should be receiving advice instead of giving it!"
"<at>rccola1966 Unfair!"
"For those who missed today's FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 -- especially w/ me talking about Mike Rice -- here ya go: http://t.co/C6ApJsc2Ex"
"<at>djoint28 But we don't. So all we can go by is what we definitively know!"

"<at>VJaddou that's acttually not true but you're entitled to your beliefs!"
"<at>BauerBeats that is correct. Not with my Bracket for Michigan. Thought Miami would make a Cinderella Ride."
"My heart is with Trey Burke and Michigan, <at>Painfull_33. But I don't like their ballhandling outside of Burke. I'll sleep on it tonight."

"Already on Sportscenter about Kobe. Back on today at 1pm and 3pm, plus on ABC this afternoon. Will save my comments for then. #TickedOff."
"Honestly, how should I feel about what happened to Kobe? And Tiger Woods, for that matter? Should Tiger have disqualified himself?"
"Who knows? Depending on what tweet I like, I might quote you on FIRST TAKE. Do NOT put it past me."

"<at>Twinyuzy Cool!"

"<at>TstarkTheBeast I'd cry. Unless I'm in Atlanta. Then nnot so much :-)"
"Damn! Mark Sanchez sitting courtside, just got roundly booed. Don't even know why they showed him on the jumbotron."
"Not pleased with the Knicks right now. Jeff Green has 20. Avery's got 11, plus troubling Felton. And NY is spectating, hoping Melo saves'em"
"These are the damn Boston Celtics. You'll need to do more to beat them. J.R. Smith is going to have to provide a punch. Gotta help out Melo."

"<at>JeremyHarvey7 Thank You!"
"<at>James_Martin34 :-)"
"How do you say I'm nowhere to be found when I'm right here inside MSG, <at>Trey_Oh5, and you're at home? Just a thought!"

"<at>CharmCity87 only to those who don't comprehend or pay attention."
"<at>MartinAbdulahad I'm appalled by what he said about Kobe and his dismissive he's acted towards players. Nothing more. #ISleepWell."

"<at>mazzio02 yes"
"Boston is still dangerous, but to be nearly 7 min into the game and for them to have just 7 pts after 2 days off is a very bad sign for Bos."
"<at>nick_palladino You were saying??????"
"<at>_Tejedaa You were saying?"
"<at>TheReaLPeterB Who knows. Could have am impact though since Lakers don't have to worry about paying that money!"
"<at>Ace_A Yep!"
"Knicks Problems? No Ball movement whatsoever. Just Melo or JR going 1-on-1, launching long off-balance shots, then not getting back on D."
"And btw.....if you're Woodson at some pt you've got to stop switching. Felton or Prig's can't guard Pierce."
"First Take on ESPN2 right now."
"I love me some MJ, my brother. But he's an owner. He needs someone separate and apart from Brand Jordan to assemble B-Ball folks and go from"

"<at>Fibnation Who Knows?"
"<at>D_VanderHorn who said I get offended? I just respond to folks as much as I can. If that involves cussing u out from time-to-time, so be it."
"<at>Busto_Back Can't do THAT!"
"<at>Nate_LakeShow No!"
"Irrelevant and ignorant, <at>Chuck_2Deuces2.  The NFL prohibits it and that's what matters. You either want to play in the league or not."

"<at>toddgoodgod Then why was I gainfully employed BEFORE I returned? Try and learn to mind your business please. And Thank God for life!"
"No need to look for me, peeps. I'm at Celtics/Knicks. Thought Knicks would STEAL 1 here. They're looking like they'll TAKE 2. #Brooms???"
"Good Lawd! The Knicks look as if they're on the verge of sweeping the Boston Celtics. Wow!"
"Nate Robinson has gone COMPLETELY BERSERK. This is unbelievable, but impressive. As Steve Kerr would say....a REMARKABLE performance. #WOW!!"
"The Bulls are playing with more energy, enthusiasm. But Brook Lopez has got to serve a purpose. Too soft on the boards."
"<at>CT_Frum_CT I'll answer that once I see it!"
"<at>djk04101983 and you're on a new twitter page."
"<at>BGSPOTS Because ppl who cut the checks obviously know you don't know what the hell you're talking about."

"<at>lala Who Won?"
"I know this much: <at>KDTrey5 has got to take over in the 2nd half like he did in the 1st. HE -not OKC - cannot let Houston come back and win."
"<at>Gmoneyisadog I'm guessing your blocked."
"His name is Durant. He is <at>KDTrey5, one of the most lethal scorers we'll ever see. Step up and act like it. Just like you did in 1st Half."
"<at>sslovesns It's Charlotte and PJ. An ignorant question. Don't ask again."
"<at>RianAlden Not the point."
"Agreed, <at>58Choices. I know <at>JHarden13 is balling, too."

"Thanks, <at>VarsityEricBruh. Real Proud of you. Keep pushing!"
"Knicks are sloppy right now. 8 turnovers in first 13 min after avg 12 this series. Don't worry, though. Melo's off. Won't last. #RunComing!"
"Carmelo has got to pass the basketball. He's forcing things a bit too much!"
"<at>J_D_TheDon The Knicks haven't been out of the 1st round since 2000. How can you even ask that question."

"Knicks down 29-27 at end of 1st, but I like this. At this pace, Knicks will win this game. Pacers don't excel at this pace."

"And don't get me started on the Spurs depth, consistency, perimeter shooting and how there's no answer for Tony Parker. And what is SA zones"
"I'll be ecstatic is <at>KingJames and <at>DwyaneWade and the crew wins, but LeBron can't do it by himself. And D-Wade at 50 percent isn't enough."

"I really hope <at>DwyaneWade is okay after attempting to block Duncan's shot. He's playing fantastic."
"I've learned something I already knew just in the last few minutes. The Spurs CANNOT win w/o T. Parker. Even if they go up 3-1."
"Miami's right on course to win this game. It helps that TIAGO SPLITTER is a complete waste. And Manu Ginobli isn't must better. On both ends"
"Aaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <at>DwyaneWade has SHOWN UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>NewzFlash23 Told your punk $#*.<at> to watch your language. Consider yourself blocked. Have a nice life!"
"<at>td9867 Skip!"
"Folks are getting on my damn nerves. I picked the Spurs in 7 at start! Then you analyze what you see. Whoever goes up 3-2 has got the series"
"How is this difficult to comprehend. Game 5 will not decide this series!"
"One of the best movies EVER, <at>justsanaa. I'll be there opening night!"
"If y'all want to whine and moan about the NBA Finals directly to me, this is the place to do it: ESPN NY (98.7FM). Call-in: 800.919.3776."

"<at>G_money1018 True!"
"<at>cory_cl Evidently you listen. How else would you know what we say. #Shallop!"
"I thought Pop should give Gary Neal more PT. Didn't see Ginobili in the starting lineup coming. Gutsy move on Pops' part. Got Ginobili going"
"Here's the deal: D-Wade is the MVP for Miami right now, but tonight is about Pops' brilliant move to START Manu --  somrthing I didn't see."
"With the starters, Manu has lanes open he didn't have before. Mike Miller and others are on him instead of pest like Norris Cole. It's done"
"Wonders for Manu. He's an entirely different player because of it. The Spurs - who've gone small - are an entirely different TEAM b/c of it"
"Now we'll see how Spoelstra responds to Pops latest chess move. It's ain't checkers, that's for sure. We'll know the results in 12 minutes."

"Here's all I'm noticing right now: Tim Duncan ain't trying to have a Game 7. He's trying to finish this off right now."
"Right now, <at>KingJames looks lost. One minute Leonard is on him. The next, it's Diaw. The next, S.A. is collapsing. He doesn't know what 2 do"
"Go 'head <at>KingJames. What a 4th-qt performance. Ginobili has returned to his AWFUL self. If SA loses this game, don't know how they win GM 7"

"Half ends with Bama scoring 28 unanswered, AND they get the ball back for the 2nd half."
"Nick Saban is simply the man. Not because he's 63-3 when leading at the half. It's him pointing out the mental errors, then telling us re:"
"Yeldon's act after the TD: ""That's Just Not Us. That's not who we are. That's not what we do."" A LEADER OF MEN. Plain and Simple."
"Don't think for one second I DON'T believe Manziel will respond. He will. This game will be epic."

"Noah hits 2 freebies. Damn!"
"Big baseline J miss by Melo. But big turnover by Rose, who's had his moments but hasn't shot well."
"Big turnover by Melo. Just can't let that happen in a game this tight!"
"Neither can Rose, though."
"Questionable loose-ball foul called on Joakim Noah. But Tyson Chandler misses FT with 10.8 second left; makes second. Bulls can win it here!"
"Derrick Rose drives right and lofts 1-handed floater over Felton and Chandler with 5.7 second left. Damn! Big-time shot. Good D by Knicks."

"<at>Daking_12 I don't have to. You'll see."

"CJ Watson for 3. Now the Knicks are in trouble."
"2 missed wide-open 3's. Knicks lucky, but I'll take it!"

"Btw....let me not fail to give Christian Ponder kudos for a good day. He actually wasn't bad at all. But I still expect the Packers to win."
"Also, I'm loving what I'm seeing from Carolina, but especially Cam. Didn't seem fazed down 16-3 at all. Cool and Calm. Impressive!"

"<at>PhilsEaglesND That is absolutely correct!"
"<at>EvanHiggins Incorrect!"
"I've tried long enough to be. Cool, but I'm officially concerned about Kidd and the Nets. Houston is STOMPING them right now. #GodAwful!"
"This does not look like some situation where they're just struggling with chemistry. Williams and Lopez must come back SOON. Season could be"
"Over by the time they arrive with the way things are looking. This is just bad!"
"Wow! 16.7 second left, down 104-101 to lakers and B. Jennings misses first 2 of 3 FT's. But Jordan Farmar responds by missing both FT's."
"Det still has a chance. Needs to get ball back in Jennings' hands. He was handling things until those missed FT's. Give it back to him!"
"Off. Foul on Josh Smith (Charging). J.S. Had no business making that play. Should've given it up. Hero move."
"2 min left in game and the Wizards don't even have 70 vs. Pacers. I like John Wall, but he might need to be quiet until his team gets better"
"The Knicks are trailing at the half, shotting"
"The Knicks are trailing at the hald in Denver, shooting 9 percent from 3-pt range. Damn! When is my misery going to end with these dudes?"
"Went back to Nets/Rockets Game. Bad news is Rockets have hit 18 3's. Good news is that Nets are only down by 24. #MoralVictories(Ugh!)"
"The Nets had better hope Prokorov isn't looking at their bench. Lost! Lethargic! Demoralized! Lost!"
"Rockets had 31 assists on 39 made baskets. Did what they wanted to do."
"Good to see Jrue Holiday back in Philly. 20 pts, 13 assists. Just saw him hug Jason Richardson. Forget JR was still in the league (injuries)"
"Good game between OkC and Golden State. 24.3 second left,...oKC up 104-103. GSW has missed 6 FT's this quarter. Not good!"
"Amen Brother, <at>daldridgetnt. Amen!"
"Overtime in OKC. Loved that KD was Iso'd, but hated his off-balance, fall-away shot. Should've gotten a better one. Give it to RW b4 that!"
"Smart of RW TO ATTACK rim and get Bogus...I mean BoGUT...to foul out."
"Serge Ibaka....5 blocks vs. SA last game, 4 this game. He patrols the paint like that and KD and RW stay healthy, look out San Antonio."
"Big-time move by Harrison Barnes. Mark Jackson told me he was gonna make even more noise this season. He's got a career-high 26. I like it!"
"Wow! Big-time turn-around 3-pt by Westbrook with 1/10th of a second left. OKC 113-112 lead. Wow!"
"Isiah Thomas just made a very valid point about Westbrook: ""He takes his matchups PERSONAL."" Very true. RW is a Rebel."
"Sorry about the Williams/Lopez comment earlier. I mean KG. I knew Lopez returned."
"<at>DebbieDowner287 so. He needs to keep it up."
"<at>venramamurthy Shallop!"
"Good lawd. JR, shitty turnaround shot. Just awful. And Randy Foye followed up with a 3. Denver up 94-85 with 1:43 left. #DamnDamnDamn!"
"Damnit Foster. I haven't seen too many FG hooks like that bad, but that wasn't a damn False Start penalty on Alabama. Bogus call."
"Look! I wasn't saying he didn't flinch. I'm saying that's a Bogus rule. What are you gonna penalize him for next? Passing Gas. #GoodLord!"
"What the hell is going on! A punter's gonna be the MVP now (Clark)? This is making me depressed already. <at>RealSkipBayless is smiling. Damn!"
"Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!McCarron to Cooper. 99 Yards! Haaaa!!!!!"
"Yyyeeeeaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Who the hell do y'all think y'all are going for it on 4th-and-inches against Bama. Way to do your job Hubbard!"
"RRRRRROOOOLLLLLLLLLLLlLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL"
"TTTTTTIIIIIIDDDDEEEEE!!!!!!!"
"<at>NotTheFakeJeffC Shut the hell up :-)"
"Good Lord. Where the hell was the safety? How was Lewis that open. G. Smith almost blew that one!"
"Btw......real smart of Jones to pop the punter while running out of bounds on that play. Dude may be too busy to put Bama in bad field pos."
"Damn! Damn! I'm so done with this dude Cade Foster. He did everything but kick it into his OL's backside! No wonder the block. #DonewithHim"
"Mother Hubbard! Damn!"
"Btw....as an aside before OT, what the hell was coach Hoke thinking. Who cares that his PLAYERS wanted to go for 2-pt conv? He's the coach!"
"<at>Jim_Hill But he wasn't, so now what!"
"No <at>#*#*<at>$<at>$* way!"
"Unbelievable!"
"Gotta admit, great way for it to end though. <at>RealSkipBayless was right. Give Skip his props. Called it. Said something divine would occur."
"A rarity, but Saban dropped the ball. Didn't have a single athlete on the field for coverage. Was totally unprepared for a 57-yard missed FG"
"And Btw.......the way that FG missed, Griffith should've kicked the previous two Field Goals."
"Awful Awful day for Alabama. They lose a shot at the Nat'l Championship and probably the Heisman (McCarron) too. Devastating!"
"<at>NYCDOTxNWRC I don't bet!"
"<at>Abmilleresquire I didn't cuss. Just used symbols to show you what was in my head....not coming out of my mouth. Calm down!"

"<at>mrschmidt3 Haaaaaaa! Now that's funny!"
"<at>DrewWhiteside Oh, Shut up! It's sports you fool. What do you want? Me to sound like a politician. Stop whining!"
"Ii like what I'm seeing from Houston in this Rockets/Spurs' Game. Especially from Terrence Jones. Spreads the floor. Makes Houston's offense"
"Better. Free D-Howard up to operate. Now D-Howard has to capitalize and continue to improve his post-game."
"Real nice pass from Ginobli to Belinelli. I tell ya, SA passes like crazy and Belinelli seems to be THE perfect fit. Could win it all."
"Hope everyone's well. Posted something on my new facebook page: http://t.co/J5FM9O6HMG. Take a look if ya want to."
"Wouldn't go that far, <at>BrandonTierney. But I'll say this: 7-years, $182 million (avg. $26 mil). Cano deserves that!"
"Testing from my iPhone. Testing from my iPhone"
"Everyone deserves what the market dictates, <at>BrandonTierney. I'm just alluding to what his talent/production warrants. But we'll see."
"<at>JRPride1 Ugh! Damn!"
"<at>CThacarter05 Wouldn't go that far. And you weren't saying that late in the 4th. Too bad the Tide had the worst FG Kicker in history!"
"I addressed that on First Take the next day, <at>mookie_smash. You shouldn't have missed it!"
"I'm sorry, <at>BrendaLarbre. Do you see me on First Take on a Saturday or Sunday? Wait until Monday please!"
"<at>tonyv2527 nope"
"<at>mikeylis Keep watching!"
"<at>tonyv2527 Thanks so much"
"<at>Theyankfan1995 Can't rule out anything right now"
"I'm telling you, man, I don't know about this dude Milliner. Bad enough he's struggled with coverage all season, but now you can't tackle?"
"And by the way, what the hell was I thinking in picking the Cardinals. My bad. Forgot all about Carson Palmer. Pathetic performance today."
"<at>lovesdoggs58 all of them. I have multiple TV's and the NFL Package!"
"And now Gould misses a 47-Yarder for Chicago. Does anyone want to win this damn game in Minnesota."
"Switched to a little b-ball. Gotta admit: watching Clips/Pacers. B. Griffin is NOT backing down from West at all. Good battle. If he can be"
"Touch vs. West, he can be tough with anyone else, including his nemesis Zach Randolph. Gotta give Blake a little credit here. Fair is Fair!"
"<at>iAmNumberThree_ No sir. That would be Skip....who took all credit away from everyone b/c Tebow deserved all the credit."
"Manning and Decker should be ARRESTED! What they're doing to the rookie (Cooper) is criminal. Beyond Cruel and unusual punishment. Damn!"
"I cannot believe how many passes KC has dropped today. I've counted 5 in the 3rd QT, alone. Jenkins! Avery! Can't blame Alex Smith for this!"
"Yes. We're ALWAYS READY. First Take in the House.....coming at ya on ESPN2. We're here."
"My apologies for saying on First Take that the Knicks were winless in November. I mean Winless AT HOME! Then again, does it really matter!"
"So much for my damn prediction. I can barely hear with all that noise in Seattle, so  imagine how it is for N.O."
"This is freakin embarrassing. Game over and the first quarter hasn't even ended. I thought I was watching Seattle vs. N.O. -- not the Jets!"
"Okay now! Maybe we will have a game afterall."
"<at>David_F_Ladies We will!"
"I'm sitting here going back-and-forth watching Heat/Pistons, Nets/Nuggets. What. A HIDEOUS damn performance from Brooklyn. Just Awful!"
"At the rate things are going right now, who knows what's going to happen next. Seriously!"
"<at>TheHendonator12 God's honest truth!"

"Thank you, My. Lord, for giving us Nelson Mandela. Rest in eternal peace!"
"Man, I just left the Knicks Game. What a beatdown. Woodson survives. Melo thrives and the Nets have regressed to a new form of Ugly. Damn!"
"Btw...we'll be discussing famous Jameis on First Take in the AM. I'll wait until then to go ""Primetime"" on Skip and anyone else."
"1 more thing: pay no attention to these embellished Google alerts on Melo. I reported what I've been told and I stand by it. But I never...."
"Once said Melo told me anything because he did not. Melo will say he wants to stay a Knick until he's out the door, as he should."
"Haaaaaa!! I'm just going home from Knicks/Nets. Just turned on the TV. RIGHT IN TIME to witness Shaub's game-deciding INT. #Cannotmakethisup"
"<at>ChilllyWillly80 damn good question right now"

"Haaaaa, <at>ARBernard. Love it! As always, anything you need, sir! I'm here."
"Thank you for the kind words, <at>MtgRecruiter. So thoughtful of you to say!"
"Let me be clear: Feel free to come at me all you want about my position of the DA, Politician and Local PD regarding Jameis. I could give"
"Less than a damn! I said an investigation should take place regarding those folks due to their behavior. NOT JAMEIS. He's exonerated. But..."
"Their behavior was beyond inappropriate. It was disgustingly blase. And anyone who thinks otherwise about that presentation can KICK ROCKS!"
"I try my dear! I try!"
"Correct!"
"<at>MK_768 Yes, I am hurt!"
"<at>joshtetlow Thank You, Sincerely!"
"<at>MtgRecruiter A bigger woman wouldn't take time out of her life to sound like something less just to make that point. Learn before u teach!"
"<at>palmettobogey Thank You. He meant the world to all of us."
"What the hell is going on? Where is THE OHIO STATE? Did they forget a trip to the Nat'l Championship is on the line!"
"Big-time stop by MSU on that 4th down. But I've gotta say, Meyer has been somewhat predictable this entire half."
"Oh my goodness. Langford for the TD with 2:16 left. OSU's about to go down. Where's thee 5th ranked rushing defense? Damn. MSU is rolling!"
"Ohio State has 13 total yards in the 4th Quarter this far. Disgraceful!"
"The SEC will play for a Nat'l title....AGAIN!"
"<at>DwayneBaldwin chill bro. It's against the Raiders. Consider the opponent."
"<at>ESegarra86 you don't even want to know. I watched some of the atrocity. Football Sunday is the only thing that prevented me from vomiting"
"This is exactly what infuriates folks about the Lions. How can Stafford and his center make such a mistake on the snap? Simply no discipline"
"Btw.....pleased with Geno and the Jets today. Even if it is vs. the Raiders"
"I swear to Goodness, in aall my years of watching NFL, I've never -- ever -- seen an ending like these last 2 min of Ravens/Vikings."
"Another potentially great finish: Pats/browns!"
"Apologies to those who received retweet from <at>Seanhannity about the Jets. Now he's got y'all thinking they'll make the playoffs. #Not"

"<at>FunnyPicsDepot Man, this tweet was funny as hell. Gotta admit, I was cracking up when I saw it. It's what I'm thinking of 1/2 time w/ Skip."
"<at>DeionSanders You tell me, Prime. I'm flabberghasted. Makes no damn sense. I hate blowouts. Especially ones that come on late."
"<at>SeannConnellyy Consider yourself acknowledged."
"<at>yf3787 What do you expect? Don't judge the man before Christmas Day against the Heat. Why do ya think he came back early?"

"HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS???"
"<at>isprint11 WEAK?"
"<at>MarkAffue Nobody cares. But I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing from I.T. Also think DeMarcus Cousins could be best big man in the game."

"<at>KINGBOY305 Please tell your sister Mr. Stephen A sent a sincere Happy Birthday."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the 1st QT. Is not even over yet and the Knicks are down by 16 (25-9). My God!!!"
"Amen, <at>BrandonTierney. Damnit!"
"Right now <at>RealSkipBayless looks like a prophet. A Composed Miami is outplaying an emotional Pacers' squad. Indy needs to calm down. #Relax"
"Mia is forcing turnovers (13 by Indy), negating fast-break opportunities and simply hustling on defense. Indy wants this TOO BAD. Mistake!"
"Listening to my boy, Greg Anthony. He's absolutely correct: Paul George was worse player for Indy in 1st 1/2. Wasn't ready to play vs LeBron"
"Uh oh! Paul George is starting to feel it now. Back-to-Back 3's."
"While Paul george puts on a show, I switch to the Knicks' game and see Coach Woodson looking as if he's on the verge of tears. #SoBadNY!"
"Kyrie Irving's Line: 37, 11 and 1 TO. I know the boy is nice, but is that about HIM, or more about Felton and Pablo? Just a question! Damn!"
"I meant mini-run by George. Hibbert's been the man for Indy tonight!"
"An airball by <at>KingJames with 51.8 left. Would've made score 86-84. Forced it, though. Didn't need that!"

"<at>intheclutch903 Thank you so much. Much appreciated."
"<at>meangeneOO7 It's more to it than that. But for the most part, I agree with you."
"<at>DJFester1 It's flagrantly false. And being, I assume, a minority, you should have more of an appreciation for my candor re: my own instead"
"<at>DJFester1 of looking for something to whine about just because you disagree with me. It's weak and pathetic. You're better than that."

"<at>R_Stow40 <at>KTidaback You're right. It's the damn IFB in my ear, cutting off sound, forcing me to talk louder. Gotta work on that. U right."
"<at>Adam_Wigs Haaa. He'd better not come in last place again :-)"
"<at>ItsSubair Possibly 2 or 3. He's No. 1 sometimes, but fades occasionally."
"<at>Quentin_1317 Big time talent. Reminds me of a slightly bigger Grant Hill."
"<at>duzerjones They're legit. They have a chance. I don't believe they'll win, but they can beat almost anybody."
"Hello, <at>MaMcCleary. What part of 'GO READ MY FACEBOOK PAGE did you not understand?"
"<at>thebroncx Spare me. Shanahan is trying to make himself look good. He's had more than a year to do this to RG3. 1 playoff win in 14 years."
"I'm confused, <at>thebroncx. I thought Coach' last name was Shanahan, not Romo."
"<at>sickwidit15 Haaaaaaa. Good for you!"
"<at>xotovio Amen. Even I know that :-)"
"<at>Tip What up, Big Boy! Always good to see you around. Happy Holidays to you and yours. Be well."
"<at>_JTizz_ Thank you so much."
"For a day, even for a few hours, it's okay to ALLOW yourself to be Happy. Just finished taping the Arsenio Hall Show. Love it.#Humbled"
"<at>Boy4rmdaBart Meritocracy. I said ""A"" meritocracy"
"Hope y'all enjoyed me on <at>ArsenioHall last night. I haven't seen it yet, but I appreciate all the love folks are showing me."
"<at>CraigHuwel thanks my man!"
"<at>DJWishbone thanks so much!"
"<at>Teddyndouba Thanks"
"<at>B1Get2It You mean like you're saying a whole lot of nothing right now!"
"<at>CaseyHuckel When did <at>kobebryant EVER say: I am NOT a Black Man? The answer would be......NEVER!"
"Absolutely, <at>mrsCook1017. But Sabrina IS sexy, though!"
"<at>joseeeph375 you're absolutely right about that. I'm so disgusted I don't know what to do with myself"
"<at>jamespk25 for as long as it takes"
"<at>keepingitrill I'm ecstatic with what I'm doing with First Take and SPORTSCENTER. If folks miss Quite Frankly so much, should've supported."
"<at>Only1Hab huh! What are you talking about?"
"<at>GetReady69 Spare me with your ignorant behind. You don't know what you're talking about and I'm not about to educate you. Stay stupid."
"<at>illedraiccir  Thank You"
"<at>haikujulio haaaaaaa"
"<at>ATXANT10 Congrats on elevating your basketball stature!"
"<at>Reegs316 upside vs. having reached a ceiling. Dalton can play. But he's no game-changer. Cincy goes where that defense takes it"
"<at>mraweda it's my place to answer a damn question if asked! Who the hell asked you to comment to me? Didn't you take that liberty? #BeQuiet"
"<at>codyrock14 Not the point. That crossed the line"
"<at>Miiiiiiiiiikkee Finally? It's been said since D'Antoni arrived"
"<at>PBonnee  You're welcome. Much appreciated"
"<at>RealGid90 Yes, I'm aware of this"
"<at>ZachAnderson111 You're either on crack or a flat-out liar. Said no such thing"
"<at>C24F Thank You so much"
"<at>Reegs316 ok"
"<at>infamouz_dre Yes Sir!"
"<at>TheRealAnindya haaaaa. Thanks!"
"<at>jsamp01 I don't recall saying anything to YOU! And I'll do what I want when I want. Appreciate the support, though :-)"
"<at>MrBaseball3518 Not an Authority! Just a commentary. You trying to tell me EVERYONE thinks Mack Brown should stay? You're not that lost."
"<at>HottyToddy1000 Yep!"
"<at>johnnygunnzz1 You Wish!"
"<at>stanick Thank You!"
"<at>Belac_Yoccm Yep! :-)"
"<at>Pinkrozzay1 I usually am. :-)"
"<at>ReillyKilbride Thank You!"
"<at>Just_AverageJoe please. Your sorry behind was probably glued to your seat!"
"<at>gfroula56 you wish!"
"<at>ScarberryChris Nah! Kinda like the name I have!"
"This weather is treacherous, y'all. NJ Turnpike looks like a death trap. Gotta be safe. Wish me luck"
"<at>aluminic08 I've got that covered. She's the best assistant in the world!"
"<at>CoachD_Willis Ditto!"
"Folks have misconstrued my take on Texas' Coach Mack Brown. See what I had to say about that on my page: http://t.co/J5FM9O6HMG"
"<at>raycort4 not yet. What's happening?"
"<at>KrazyChino huh?"
"<at>FuckItThankU Thanks, buut what are you talking about?"
"<at>BroJoeSki Haters hate. They misconstrue on purpose just to confuse and create chaos, specifically for those they don't like. #oldesttrick"
"<at>SeanFlynnn grow up and pay attention. We didn't bring it up. We were debating if there was validity to the Playmaker alluding to it."
"<at>Mray1084 good question"
"<at>bluejaygunnyon sorry. This pays more :-)"
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!How 'Bout them Cowboys!!!"
"HOW 'BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!! Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Just posted something on my Knicks at http://t.co/J5FM9O6HMG. Check it out if you like."
"I just got word that former Presidential Candidate, Herman Cain sent out a tweet, liking what I said on this link: http://t.co/n39rJSx9bf."
"My response to it all are 2 post I just placed on my Facebook page: http://t.co/HbyHnrMKER. Feel free to go and take a look. I'm not hiding."
"Haaaaa! Man, you crazy! You good, Big Boy!"
"Appreciate you too, bro! I'm happy as hell here at ESPN, but that doesn't mean I don't miss my boys."
"For folks who were wondering who I was talking to, it's one of my producers from my FoxSports morning Show, Big Brother Jake. Miss that man!"
"<at>ophenomenalx why! I had nothing to hide. Was talking to my boy Jake!"
"<at>BenryHailey Not at all!"
"One more message for everyone, but Especially the Black Community. It's posted at http://t.co/cRbuZB0psy. It needed to be said. Take a look."
"My latest column on the Knicks. Brace yourself:http://t.co/kDqnFYWfe6"
"<at>rolyvic11 I talk the way I talk. Get over it!"
"That's such a damn lie, <at>SolomonSyed. That is not what I said!"
"<at>bigdaddyray62 Thanks"
"<at>RobertElledge Thanks my man!"
"<at>RAY_inNYC What's Machine Gun History?"
"<at>KaiserSoz3 Thank You!"
"<at>zackgoldwasser today was about the Pacers. Full interview will probably be Sunday Conversation!"
"<at>BharrisBrad No problem!"
"<at>addiggs Not sadder than you!"
"My lesson for the day: don't waste my time fending off lies about what I say. Ppl lie on purpose to get attention. Stupid to give it to them"
"See, this is exactly why the Pacers are so tough. Not making shots, def breakdowns and on the road, and they still have an 11-10 lead."
"They're not backing down. They want this matchup all day long, win, lose or draw! Conference Finals Matchup inevitable. #UnlessNetsComeAlive"
"In case y'all want to hear something hysterical, check out my love-doctor segment on ESPN Radio w<at> <at>RyanRuocco today: http://t.co/5J1Vx3drml"
"I really need to start giving Lance Stephenson some more love. Damn, his game has improved. Handle. Jumpshot, etc.! Very impressive."
"<at>Midnite86D Actually, all the time. Just don't ask if I've helped myself because that answer would be Heeeelllllllllllll No!"
"<at>porkchopxpress3 They Aight!"
"<at>JohnnyRiles_ What's up my brother!"
"<at>sportsTruth216 MY NETS?????"
"<at>jsjsimp Agreed!"
"<at>Makaveli55 What up Ram Fam!"
"<at>GBeck765 I know more watching something in 5 min than you'd know by watching it in a year. #Shallop!"
"<at>Willmatic559 Agreed!"
"<at>Ink_OrangeJuice who cares about his hot hand. I'm talking about the overall improvement in his game."
"Heat look out-of-sync, outmuscled and discombobulated. Plus they're missing FT's. They lose this game and Pacers' confidence will blow up!"
"Good defense with Miami there. If Indiana doesn't stop turning ball over, they may need to do EVERYTHING they can to get Rondo."
"Bigtime jam by LeBron. Making it a 5-pt deficit. 16-6 run by Miami. Whew! It's about to get real up in here."
"I'll always have love for you bro. Call me when you get a chance!"
"LeBron: injured, 8-for-13, hitting 3's, defending and doing it all. So much for <at>RealSkipBayless getting on <at>KingJames"
"I believe <at>KingJames. Everyone respects <at>mchalmers15. How can you not? If I felt differently, damnit I'd say so!"
"Ugh :-) <at>CharissaT. Figures you'd do that to me!"
"Ya got me good big boy, <at>Hoya2aPacer. Payback's a you know what :-)"
"<at>ArabMamba24 sure! Why not!"
"Yes Sir, <at>Spygirl411. But let's be clear: no need for tears if Patrick chooses Sabrina :-)"
"Haaaaaaaa!<at>sarahhart27"
"Daaaaammmmmmnnnnnn,<at>_KevinVicencio"
"Haaaaa, <at>Shopkin2. You're hilarious!"
"<at>TREfranklin504 Thank You!"
"This is why I may turn into <at>RealSkipBayless and stop tweeting, <at>S_Srivatsan12. I'm sick of lies. Never said PG didn't get fouled. I said.."
"I did not care, <at>S_Srivatsan12. That its BigBoy rules. This is why <at>RealSkipBayless  is right not to tweet. If ur gonna lie, why bother!"
"<at>PhilipChander I refuse to communicate with Liars."
"<at>raycort4 He'd beat Maidana in a rematch, but he deserved to lose. Broner needs to respect the game like we respect his game. Plays too much"
"<at>Keyser_Soze3662 nope"
"<at>AppersonMichael There ya go w/ the retweet. Just did it. Happy Birthday."
"Amen brother <at>DeionSanders . Amen!"
"My apologies to a bunch of folks who think I'm following them when I'm not. My new phone has gone berserk and it's doing that. Not Me!"
"Again, my apologies!"
"Haaaa! What up homie!"
"<at>robert_andrews7 Oh Stop it!"
"<at>ericswdds_eric Hey Doc!"
"<at>Dmikesworld Why?"
"<at>BRODY12 I feel the same way I've always felt!"
"<at>thisistwayne That's a very stupid observation on your part. Honestly, I have no clue what your talking about."
"<at>be_see_why Appreciate ya!"
"To all my Cowboys' Haters out there, don't sweat. This win is the PERFECT SETUP to a heartbreaker next week. Don't you worry 'bout a thing:)"
"Amen my man, <at>richeisen. Amen!"
"My God, where are the Bears' pride? Where's their dignity? Just because GB and Detroit lose you go to Philly and lay this egg? #LostRespect"
"I'll be there my man, <at>RealSkipBayless. Don't you worry!"
"<at>JrzyJoePiscopo not if Eli doesn't play better and they continue to avoid finding a running game."
"Buckle up! First Take in the House. <at>RealSkipBayless thinks he has me. He'd better ask somebody!"
"<at>flash_roberts All love bro. <at>KevinHart4real is my man. Good peeps. Real proud of him. Plus, I know he's gonna get me back (Haaaa)"
"Leave it to one of the NY Teams to tarnish Christmas. The Nets look awful today. Just awful. No way else to put it! Feel sorry for my man BK"
"Hope Paul Pierce sticks around and man's up by answering questions. Still, feel sorry for him and KG. Champions like those 2 deserve better!"
"Merry Christmas Bro, <at>JalenRose. To you and the whole Countdown Crew! Keep Pushing!"
"Well, I guess that means the Knicks will lose by 40 instead of 30, huh,<at>SportsCenter. #MerryChristmas"
"Knicks Game. 1st Possession: Turnover by Beno. Jumper from Durant. Right now I'm wondering if the Knicks will lose by 50. Seriously!"
"Okay. I'm going to stop. It REFUSE to be this agitated on Christmas Day. I just Refuse!"
"Chance favors the prepared mind. Be ready to claim what comes your way before someone does it 4 you. Then bitterness arises. Don't allow it."
"For those who didn't catch that, it was my way of saying Happy New Year. Meaning be ready to make the New Year a Happy One."
"<at>Primetime000 The guy from the Steven Seagal movie."
"<at>sjkatz23 I'm not going that far but I know he'll run through Chicago"
"CP3. Damn this boy is special. Single-handedly carrying the Clips right now. BG is doing well, too, though but Portland is tough as hell"
"See, this is why Portland is so dangerous. They're tall, which means they cause matchup problems for everyone. But are also lethal on 3's"
"<at>boobaru162 why? What the on was earth for"
"Greg Hardy and Carolina's front-7 are doing their thing vs. Atlanta. Panthers get the No .2 seed, then NFC playoff pic gets interesting"
"It is absolutely unbelievable to me that the Chargers are blowing this opportunity w / playoffs on the line. KC beating then w/ backups!"
"<at>SnowALegend yeah! All you pathetic Cowboys' fans say that. Until y 'all choke, then you're nowhere to be found"
"<at>PLinny32 you're argument is weak. I said what I said pertaining to his uptempo style, saying he'd need to adjust. Never said he'd fail"
"<at>PLinny32 Was I wrong to make the assumption that you know how to read? Look at the other tweets, then mine . There 'a a difference."
"<at>JdogdaBoss58 I like the way I look. At let me say this for the record: hearing a bunch of men commenting on my looks is not how I flow!"
"<at>StuartLobster <at>RealSkipBayless <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>SpiderAnderson We'll see. That was real ugly though. Still, Weidman is no joke. Except...."
"<at>stephenasmith <at>StuartLobster <at>RealSkipBayless <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>SpiderAnderson....when it comes to Tebow. Then...Weidman needs prayer"
"<at>WCiastko If Cowboys win i will wear the Jersey"
"<at>Officially_DJ I never said he would. I said he SHOULD once Tannenbaum was out, but that he deserved to stay on thru next season"
"<at>Markscrucial87 wrong. You're not paying attention to my predictions oh ignorant one"
"<at>BraxOnBrax19 Relax! The 4th QT has not arrived yet. Rodgers is just rusty. Bears playing good D. But AR will answer the bell."
"Great catch by Brandon Marshall. Bigtime"
"<at>Hassan1Abdulla Puh-Leeze"
"<at>PearceWhy <at>StuartLobster <at>RealSkipBayless <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>SpiderAnderson Doesn't need to be. It's Weidman's time"
"<at>bbot33  name-call again and you 'll be blocked. Grow the hell up"
"<at>VicinoB nope"
"<at>JDV_14 nope"
"<at>ayeitsjustin Enjoy. You 'll be blocked soon enough."
"Like I said peeps: just relax. Rodgers has GOT this. Just chill out"
"Loving this:  3 great games on at the same time: KC/SD, chi/GB, and Ari/SF"
"Aaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!! He 's a bbbaaaaddddd man!!! Awwwwwww. How ya like that. <at>RealSkipBayless . Haaaaa!!!"
"No matter what happens, Rodgers is not responsible for the Packers' Defense. This is on them"
"Aaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!. He's a Baaaddd Baaadddd Man. Cutler? Not so much! Haaaaaaa"
"What a great catch by this kid/rookie Patton of San Fran just now. He's the one who set up that 56-harder game-winner."
"Now I'm getting ticked off. The Eagles are making this game far more interesting than it needs to be . Come on , Man!"
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
Accident Waiting To Happen. How 'Bout Them Cowboys!  Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Sincerely , from my heart, my condolences to <at>KingJames, Kenyon Martin of the Knicks, and all if CowboysNation out there. #SIKE (Haaaaaaa)"
"First Take abut to close out the year with ya live. Oh, btw.....How 'Bout then Cowboys!!! (Haaaaa!)"
"Yes sir"
"<at>Kinghov99 <at>RealSkipBayless <at>ESPN_FirstTake That was a foul against Love . Refs missed it"
"<at>Memel00 none of your business nor mine. Ppl need to realize that."
"<at>sanjaysrik74 <at>CariChampion <at>RealSkipBayless Didn't know. Don't care."
"<at>Sport615 <at>RealSkipBayless I think that's just Skip. I don't recall being in that commercial and I certainly did not receive a check for it."
"Amen"
"Guess who's back. Yours truly with <at>RuanRuocco on ESPN Radio (98.7FM ) in NY right now. Holla"
"Cade Foster......again! Damn!"
"Still the 2nd Half to go. Alabama looks like they don't even want to be here. No Nat'l Title? Why bother!"
"Big-Time 3 by Deron Williams to give Nets 91-89 lead over OKC. Nice pass from Livingston, too. I like! I like!"
"<at>Sophia_A1621 that's a damn lie. I never said thst"
"Another big-time move by D. Will"
"18 points sine halftime by D-Will. This is what the Hell he's suppose to be doing. It 's what Nets' fans have waited for."
"Btw.....I saw what Steph Curry did to Miami tonight"
"KG was not expecting that pass. The man took just 4 shots this game. Why give him the ball. Not dmsrt"
"<at>Ink_OrangeJuice that's how I roll"
"Yeeeaaahhhhhh! Joe Johnson rainbow jumper over Ibaka for the win as the buzzer sounds. This is what he does. If D-Will plays like again....."
"Knicks just surrendered an 11-2 run. Game tied at 96 in San Antonio"
"Make that 13-2. Damn!"
"Melo ties it"
"Yeeaaahhhh!!!!! Iman Shumpert with a big-time 3 from the left-wing. Knicks lead 101-98. Shumpert's got 25. Yeeeaaahhhhhh!"
"Knicks give up 3 from top of Key to Bellinelli over Melo. (Who was picked) with 37 sec left. Damn! Damn! Damn! Score tied at 101. $&amp;<at>&amp;)<at>"
"Whoaaaaaa!!!! Sky-walking tip-follow by Shumpert off a Melo miss with 23 sec left. Shumpert has a career-high 27pts folks. Knicks 103-101"
"Yyyeeeaaaahhhhhhh!!! Knicks pull it out 105-101. 1st win of the year vs. Western Conference team. Yeeeaaahhhhh"
"Sweet, Sweet pass to Bester over Jackson. Okla. Doing it's thing"
"Nice TD pass from Knight to Shepard, too . Looked like Montana to Clarke. But I gotta say this: never thought I'd see Bama D look THIS bad!"
"Practically , CHASE_YSC. Bottom line, I look pretty damn ignorant right now. I'm man enough to admit it. Rollll Tide my you know what!"
"<at>Darkskind_Ayee you wish"
"<at>garystein71 easily. He picked Bama too. They can't protect McCarron"
"Bama gave up 10 sacks all season, and now 6 in one game. Good Lord"
"One other thing I noticed: McCarron can't scramble vs. this defense. His stock has been hurt Bigtime in his last 2 collegiate games."
"This Kid Henry is either a Bigtime player or Okla's run defense stinks"
"Even though that was a swing pass"
"Time to give Okla it's props. Tremendous speed by Striker. Bama' off. Line had a very bad night. Saban 'a got to address that D next season"
"Nonsense, <at>sy_fi516. Totally untrue. But why waste my time trying to correct lies? When I get married, those who need to know will know."
"No truth to it whatsoever, <at>Ifauxwithsports. But what else is knew."
"Thanks bro, <at>JeremyShannon1 <at>edeweysmith.  Much appreciated."
"Striker was absolutely right in what he said, <at>Grayson_S <at>RealSkipBayless. I didn't think OKLA. had a chance in hell. I was WRONG. Congrats"
"This might be the worst ,'most uninspired I've seen from Indy since Luck arrived"
"90-yard, 12-play drive. Now we have a game. A 38-10 cushion by KC is now 41-38 KC. Wow!"
"<at>pinczewski bye. Won't miss you"
"<at>MarkWyspianski just fine, I think"
"This is absolutely unbelievable. What a comeback. Luck is a baaaaaadddd young man. And Hilton isn't shabby, eithr"
"<at>pullan24 goodbye"
"<at>KINGofKINGS4eva got the colts game right"
"<at>Harp_Speaks Didn't hear you saying that when I got the Colts game right. Stick to facts idiot"
"<at>A09Alex Thank ya! Thank Ya!"
"<at>deli7to4 <at>RealSkipBayless Thanks so much. Muchapprecuated"
"<at>HitmanMello yes"
"<at>homelessdude314 Really? I'm right 95% of the time . Check the record. I 'm giving facts, not emotions"
"<at>Jay_GodReal Gracias"
"<at>RealNikeHead44 Haaaaa. Not if I'm aspiring to be George Jefferson :-)"
"<at>Martian_Maan <at>JalenRose Not sure. May be best for Lakers to just let contract expire . Trading him forces then to take on. $$$$"
"<at>DatboyJC <at>bomani_jones Amen"
"<at>drewsquare250 <at>ChrisWeidmanUFC <at>RealSkipBayless So am I. A champion and a great person. He's always welcomed on the show"
"<at>TheBlackPenseur I do what I want. Why are you so concerned about a brother's looks. Something you want to tell us???????"
"<at>Fuzzy_Lumpkins_ <at>RealSkipBayless Absolutely. No one on the Texans coaching staff should be retained after this season"
"Typical Cincy. Never show up when it's time. As for Marvin Lewis: 11 seasons and not a single playoff victory. Enough's Enough. Goodbye!"
"B.S. I know Dalton stinks when it counts most,  but I need a coach who can figure out how to remedy that over the course of 11 years.  Sorry"
"<at>nbcsvu <at>audreycnn That was one of the best episodes I've ever seen, so I'm looking forward to it."
"<at>LouieBiggavelle The biggesr"
"<at>redwaaz 11 years. Not one single playoff victory. Don't get emotional. Give someone else a chance"
"<at>J_Money1025 And I mean every word of it"
"<at>redwaaz please. Just keep listening."
"<at>broussard_jamar <at>ESPN_FirstTake Okay. Fine. What about the other 10 years"
"<at>redwaaz in your dreams. He's entitled to his opinion. Don't think for 1 SECOND that changes my stance"
"<at>J_Money1025 Thank You. Remind the few ignorant critics out there"
"<at>CrisNbc mistake"
"<at>redwaaz sure didn't"
"<at>jd32utsa Nothing. I stand by what I said"
"<at>Sidv726 <at>ItsRoMofo <at>RealSkipBayless Good. Makes me feel even better"
"I don't care about folks ""comfort"" <at>GarnerBussell. I care about truth and justice. That's the only way to make the world a better place"
"<at>LakersLifestyle Didn't say he was the reason. I said he's had 11 years"
"<at>JohnCWozniak Thanks Bto"
"On my damn: Nick Marshall is elusive, plus he's made a couple of nice throws. Okay! Okay! Still think the Seminoles will crush. #TitleTalk"
"Auburn's a bit surprising here. Definitely expected them to run more earlier. #TitleTalk"
"Awwwwww Damn! #TitleTalk"
"Def. Front for Auburn getting penetration. FSU needs to nip this in the bud right now . #TitleTalk"
"What in the hell is going on? Damn. Auburn's defense looks hellacious. #TitleTalk"
"Oops. Mistake by Auburn. Riffing the punter. Could be a momentum shifter. # TitleTalk"
"To be real, right now I do not see that smile on Famous Jameis' face. Auburn's D has come to play. Game will be decided up front. #TitleTalk"
"These FSU receivers are getting 1-on-1 coverage and can't do anything. What's up with Benjamin? #TitleTalk"
"This is not looking good for FSU. Auburn's starting to seem like it can do what it wants. I'm going to talke a break. #TitleTalk"
"I'm not going to front: the way Auburn is balling, it looks like the SEC is exposing the ACC. Damn, looking like I got juked! #TitleTalk"
"Damn. 1-total yard on last 13 offensive plays. #TitleTalk"
"Can't put this on Zjameis right now. Off. Line getting pushed around. Receivers not getting open. Auburn simply looks ready. #TitleTalk"
"Damn! Damn! Damn!, Winston. Hold onto the ball, man. #TitleTalk"
"That drive was all Jameis. Let's see if we finally have a game here. #TitleTalk"
"So far , this game is such a disappointment. I expected so much more from FSU. But it's still early, I guess. #TitleTalk"
"P.S. I haven't seen Jameis smile all evening long. #TitleTalk"
"Give my man <at>RealSkipBayless credit where it's due: he said this kid Dee Ford would make noise tonight. The man knows his CFB. #TitleTalk"
"No! Freeman! No!Not an unsportsmanlike penalty at that time. No. 2-pt conversion. Why! Why! Why! Could cost FSU. #TitleTalk"
"Ya know something: I understand what the penalty was vs. Freeman. But do you really have to call that? Let the kids decide game. #TitleTalk"
"Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh! LeVonte Whitfield. Kick Return. TD. Oh Yeah!  #TitleTalk"
"Big-time play by Marshall on the 3rd and 11. Nice job. #TitleTalk"
"Mason! Stud! Damn! #TitleTalk"
"That was a horse collar on Greene. Should've been called. #TitleTalk"
"Come on! Not a delay of game. That was on the center. #titletalk"
"Definitely pass interference. But smart on defender's part. #titletalk"
"Yyyyeeeeaaaahhhhhh!!!!!!!! Famous Jameis comes thru. 6-of-7 on that last drive . Fabulous! Just Fabulous! #Titletalk"
"Yeah! FSU did it. But Auburn played it's butt off. Predictable, their weakness (Defense) got exposed after playing great. #Titletalk"
"Best Nat'l Championship game I've seen since Texas/Vince Young beat USC /Reggie Bush. #TitleTalk"
"Glad you do buddy, <at>JTTheBrick. You know I love and respect the hell out of you, so I'm riding what you. But I do have my reservations."
"Mind your damn business and watch the show, <at>TrevisScott. Do I tell you how to do your job? #Shallop"
"<at>SKOFitness <at>RealSkipBayless Thank you so much."
"<at>morgonj Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
"Yeah, but he shouldn't be, <at>BoogBangTheroy. That honor should belong to MJ"
"Folks need to calm the hell down. Nobody's knocking Peyton this way. I'm just acknowledging that others will if all he has is 1 SB. Simple!"
"Stop annoying me by acting like you don't understand my words, misinterpreting what I'm saying. Folks are not stupid. You know what I said."
"<at>adorechristian Thank you."
"In no way did I disrespect Trent Dilfer. He's my colleague and someone I respect. I was just saying he wasn't - like others -- is not Peyton"
"<at>CScottElevate Why be disrespectful? Where does that get you in life?"
"<at>___Kees Get over it. Fathertime. Happens to us all."
"<at>MattVentiere Nope :-)"
"<at>Shamyr94 Absolutely!"
"Oh my goodness , I'm starting to get excited. My Knicks might pull this off, especially the way Shumpert is playing. Yeah ! Yeah! Yeah!"
"Big time shot by Felton. 4 min to go. Come on Knicks!!!"
"Felton again. Yes!!!!!"
"Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! Melo for 3 ! From Felton"
"Awwww dn! D-Wade for 3"
"Awwwwwwww. Stay with the slam . And what a game from Felton. 14 assists. Yes!!!!!!"
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!"
"The Lakers are trailing 101-59 with 42.4 seconds left in the 3rd QT. What other evidence do you need to confirm how awful Jim Buss is?#SoSad"
"<at>sambolef <at>NotoriousNJV <at>MikeVacc <at>RichieKalikow Haaaaa. Hilarious"
"Great pass by Luck. Just a great pass. Here 'd hoping this game stays interesting/ competitive"
"Good to see you here my man, <at>jsprinkles.Always a fan of yours. Hope you're well"
"Now it's over. Luck's 6th interception in 2 playoff games. I still believe in him. Bright future. But his season is now over"
"Good Lawd. Who the hell is Blount ? Jim Brown or Earl Campbell? Jesus!"
"Loved that Carolina went for it, but a QB dice was not the right call. Gotta have more momentum in that dituatin"
"<at>__UptownBoss that makes no sense. Send me the dtory"
"Beautiful throw by Cam. Beautiful catch by the man with the best name in the NFL (Steve Smith). I'm worries about SF with how Kap looks."
"<at>AlmightyStead Hold your horses partner. Not so fast"
"Can't even front: do far Cam just looks unstoppable and Carolina looks like the better team. Simple and plain. Taking too many hits, though."
"What an absolute B.S. call (roughing the passer) vs. Smith in that sack on Cam. No freaking way should that have been called."
"This is beyond tragic, ladies and gentlemen: http://t.co/6pOe9493bd"
"Showtime! Buckle up! First Take is coming at you on ESPN2 right now"
"<at>Smoov609 Hell Yes"
"Two things to say: <at>RealSkipBayless had better be RESPECTFUL to <at>KingJames AND <at>KevinHart4real had better behave himself. That's an order:-)"
"Somebody please tell <at>KevinHart4real that his head is suppose to come ABOVE the shoulders of the chair. Pretty Please!"
"Haaaaa, <at> MauriceBenardMB. Yes sir. I most certainly do. You're the best. Never miss it. 37 years and counting. Honored to hear from you."
"If this is the lovely Alexis, Thank You. <at>NancyLeeGrahn <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>GeneralHospital. Obviously, I'm a fan. Keep up the great work."
"And Btw, make sure to hook up with Julian <at>NancyLeeGrahn <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>GeneralHospital. Nothing wrong with having a Bad Boy in your life."

"<at>RosalieSP <at>whitewatercrew Yeah, but he's gone. Gotta move on. Plus she would've ended up with Jason had she not told A.J. About Michael"

"Lord have mercy. Durant is putting on a show."
"There's simply nothing GS can do. Durant is on fire . Won't even allow a double -team to arrive. A scoring machine. Mugging him is only hope"
"Haaaaaaaaa! Good idea"
"<at>TaddyBarnes Huh? What? Please tell me you're telling a cruel joke."
"<at>redskins_4_real Don't look at me. I'm trying to figure that one out myself"
"<at>drea_rio Thanks so much"
"<at>Oclark38 Thank You. I'll try"
"Don't even try it, <at>RealSkipBayless. Can't you at least have the decency to hedge you bets on Monday morning? ESPN_"
"Amendola didn't have one single catch. I can't wait to hear what <at>RealSkipBayless has to say about that. I wish First Take was on right now."
"See, that right there is a problem. No TD. No 1st down after Wilson is stripped by Smith. Bad sign right there. Damn!"
"49ers offense moving with no urgency whatsoever. I'm really not understanding this at all."
"Bigtime completion from Kap to Gore. V. Davis has been exposed today. Complete no-show. Understand C.C. has a lot to do with that but DAMN!"
"A VD sighting!"
"Here's my thing: you knew better than attacking Sherman all day long. Why attack him now? Why?"
"<at>Worthy1ne correct"
"Great Game, though!"
"I'll save my comments for Richard Sherman's post-game reaction for tomorrow morning on First Take on ESPN2"
"<at>Todd_Oxentenko Please. He won't get suspended."
"<at>RhysBlackerby <at>KENT_BAIRD yes I am. Various ways to celebrate an icon. Taking off to me me isn't one of them"
"<at>SMananie Thank you so much. Appreciate the love"
"There isn't an athlete alive that I'm scared of <at>AcuffJordan. They have their job to do and I have mine. That will never change. #Trust"
"<at>AcuffJordan Haaaaaa. Hilarious"
"<at>MichaelRalh <at>AcuffJordan I say what I feel. If I'm heated, I express it. If not, I don't. Appreciate honesty and not bring lied to."
"<at>mm09bb my man <at>RealSkipBayless is a lot of things bro, but that ain't want of them. I can officially and emphatically vouch for that."

"Ha Ha! I'm here hanging with my man Victor Cruz for CAMM Day.#TWCStudios"
"Great night with <at>citiprivatepass #EveningWithLegends; enjoyed interacting with <at> SI Peter King <at>jerryrice"
"Man, this pro-Seattle crowd is unbelievable. Never heard it like this for a SB. Plus , Seattle's D looks ferocious. If Wilson gets going?..."
"It's early but it's not looking good for Denver right now."
"Big-time pass by Wilson to Baldwin"
"Manning gets intercepted. Denver is without a first down for the entire 1st QT. Houston, we have a problem. It's the Seahawks!"
"What the hell is this : ET calling home? Manning is on the phone, looking like he's calling for help. Denver looks completely rattled. Damn!"
"This is unreal. This could really get ugly for Denver. Real ugly. What's up Manning! What's up!!!!"
"Unbelievable. Tim Tebow's got the best commercial this far for Super Bowl Sunday. Unemployed and still making noise. Only in America"
"It's over!"
"This might end up being the biggest blowout in Super Bowl History, the way things are looking right now ."
"Btw....these SB commercials are terrible. Not moved by any of them. Can I get just 1 funny one, please. Lawdy! Now back to Football"
"Can't front. I am in a state of shock. Manning shut down. Denver completely outclassed, outcoached, out-muscled. Just unbelievable."
"I hate blowouts in a Super Bowl. But this is legit. Pure domination. If Peyton comes back from this, it'll be for the ages"
"This is so bad......I may call in sick!"
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but Bruno is turning this out. I can't believe how entertaining this is. This boy is talented."
"This ain't even a game anymore. The only intrigue left is whether or not Manning-and-Co will score. Nothing else."
"This is so embarrassing. Broncos have been totally punked. SB Sunday ruined. It's so bad, next season won't mean anything re: Denver! Why?"
"No matter what Denver does next season we'll remember this beatdown and say: ""Screw Them! We know who they really are."""
"And btw....... If Peyton Manning gets SHUT OUT in this game, no need for anymore talk about him over Montana, Brady, etc."
"Not only was I wrong about  my pick, I actually don't blame folks for wondering what <at>TimTebow would do."
"Denver scores. Congratulations"
"Btw.....there's something wrong when the best commercial thus far is the free one by the NFL. What happened to the fun? The laughter?"
"Also, major props to the Seahawks fans. The showed up. Could say Denver fans didn't, but if we're being honest doing we really know ?"
"Come on <at>ChrisBruenn. You know good and well I wasn't saying that's a bad commercial. Just asking what happened to the laughter"
"Whoa! I see my girl Scarlett in this commercial. I get all excited , thinking I 'very seen a good commercial. Then... No body shots.#Damn!"
"This SB is so bad, it's even ruined Seattle's celebration. They've gotta wait to jump for joy. Even Marshawn is chillin w/ shoes off ."
"This game was so bad, it ended before 10pm. When's the last time a Super Bowl ended this early"
"<at>ClaytonDavidl Stay scared of the Truth: ME!!!!!! Nothing pleases me more"
"<at>ryanamspaugh Watch Peyton Manning under pressure , it serms"
"<at>domuigi Maybe. Everyone for Denver was awful , including John Fox. They should all be ashamed. Much respect to Harbaugh's 49ers 4 fighting."
"<at>ManeAight Thank You. Back tomorrow"
"<at>StegerBrent Yes sir"
"<at>MommaLynch24 Yes sir. You were right. I was wrong . Congrats to you and the Seahawks. They were so dominant I owe them a damn apology"

"Yes I did, <at>PCBearcat. <at>Rich30Everley. And I just went on SPORTSCENTER and said he should be suspended 3-to-5 games. You can't do that."
"There's nothing to talk about. Marcus Smart should be suspended 3-to-5 games. A college athlete has no business putting his hands on a fan."
"Especially a middle-aged man. Marcus Smart, by all accounts, is a good kid who made a mistake. He should be allowed to recover from this."
"BUT....you don't do what he did. It can't be allowed. It's not just about Smart. It's about sending the message that such behavior won't fly"
"Correct <at>JGeewentworth. And the fan should be dealt with Harshly. But that doesn't excuse Marcus. He could've called an official or someone."
"There were other ways to deal with this, <at>JGeewentworth. Smart 'a reaction can 'to be excused. Doing so gives the license to others. Period."

"<at>ThomasUrban5 None. Deal with him"

"I'm done. I'm just done. With the Knicks, and especially with Felton right now. This season is a mess. I'm just depressed"
"Bottom line: the Knicks couldn't get stops either. No effort resembling the 1st half. They're just finding ways to lose games. #Damn!"

"<at>TysStupidTweets <at>IAmSteveHarvey <at>fucktyler whoa! Whoa! Why are you talking about my man Steve Harvey like that?"
"Durant has picked a fine time to put forth his worse game of the season. This is unbelievable. I haven't seen him like this all year long"
"<at>xMikey89 <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>CariChampion <at>RealSkipBayless Hell Yea"
"OKC, collectively, looks God Awful. No fight. Just folding. But <at>KingJames is DESTROYING them. I really can't say anything else right now."
"No flow at all from OKC. And don't blame it on Westbrook because he's not even in the game. Just jacking up shots. 1-on-1 ball."
"What in the Hell is up? OKC bouncing balls off their feet, running NO plays, looking completely lost. What a Horrible performance. Meanwhole"
"Miami looks pretty close to flawless. LeBron's hitting shots. So is D-Wade. Ray Allen, Chris Bosh. This is the Finals from 2 yrs ago. #Damn"
"So much for intrigue. If OKC doesn't march a comeback, y'all gonna have me crying for the Spurs to be back in the Finals."
"Okay ! We'll attribute it to rust and a lack of practice time, because I truly have never seen OKC look this bad. Out if sync. Miami Defense"

"Kudos to Allan Hahn and Walky Szczerbiak for doing the Knicks Post-Game Show. This team stinks, but they still break it down w/ interest."
"I'm so damn disgusted I don't know what to do w/ myself. Orl averages 96 in regulation, but had 106. Oladipo damn near has a triple-double."
"Orl basically got on their knees and begged Felton to shoot. Oladipo got to front of the run at will. And they waste 44-and-11 by Melo."
"I'm so damn done with this team I may start taking Prozac. Good Lawd somebody help me. Help strip me if my love for this team.#BrokenHeart"

"I'm sick. I'm nauseated! I'm embarrassed. I'm furious, depressed, miserable, exhausted and totally DONE with the Knicks right now. Damn!"
"So I wake up, turn on the TV and the 1st thing I see is Raymond Felton arrested on gun charges. 2 Felony Counts. Good Goodness. #Betrayal"

"I can't believe Angulo is still standing after the shots he's taking from Canelo. But I also can't believe Canelo is allowing this slow dude"
"To touch him. Canelo does not need to take shots from this dude , although Angulo isn't getting leverage on any of his shots."
"Canelo looks like he's getting stalked. Angulo keeps coming and Canelo, although having won every round, seems like he's slowing down."
"<at>Chillyc you might be right. Angulo keeps coming."

"<at>RDunc23 you were saying?"
"Angulo is loaded with heart , but isn't that smart . He's chasing/following , but not cutting off the rim ."
"Wow! Round 8. Canelo taking shots. Talking smack, throwing back. If he can truly handle that heat, no one can touch him but Floyd."
"Good body and head movement by Canelo. His defense has improved tremendously. He keeps this up , Cotto's next. Then rematch vs. Floyd. #Must"
"Fight stopped. Terrie stoppage. Should not have been stopped. Angulo was taking shots but still standing and swinging. Had not been down."
"Wrong judgement call by ref. No warning. No anything. Wrong decision. Just flat- out wrong"
"I'm not saying Canelo would beat Floyd. I'm simply saying he'd beat anybody else which will force a rematch since he'd be the best out there"

"What an explosion by Kentucky. 15-0 run out of nowhere. Ain't over yet, but what athleticism. This is just special to watch"
"Here comes Wisconsin"
"Incredible composure by Wisconsin . Great play on the back pick for Jackson. Biggest thing: Wisconsin begging KY to shoot J's. Begging them!"
"Let me say this: if you can't make a wide-open jumper near the free throw line, you don't deserve to win this game."
"Young comes back in the game. KY's problems from the perimeter resolved!"
"Lord Have Mercy. What a dunk by Poytress"
"Great play by Jackson.....knowing the shot clock. Got away with a travel, but still smart to draw that foul on a young Andrew Harrison."
"Love to see the son (Jackson) of my boy, Jim Jackson, doing good things."

"<at>junoalejandro Yes sir"
"Guard play, Guard play, Guard play. Looking good right now. <at>RealSkipBayless."
"<at>extraORRdINary <at>RealSkipBayless If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. You barely get to see these guys. Now.... NFL and NBA? I take it personal"
"My goodness. Everything one of the Harrison's drive , they're getting stripped. Get the ball to Randle"
"Kentucky has no answer for Napier. He looks like he can do what he wants, and knows it. Wow! KY's best hope is to get it to Randle down low."
"I've rarely seen Calipari looking this helpless. KY totally rattled. Can't hold onto the ball."
"I cannot believe this. KY can't drive. Can't hold into the ball. This might be a blowout if they don't get their act together fast"
"Look damnit, put a Box-and-1 on Napier. Deny him the ball. Don't let him shoot. Whatever it takes. Mug the damn man if you have to. JESUS!!!"
"It's a miracle Kentucky isn't down by 20 at the break. I'll admit that much <at>RealSkipBayless. Gotta say, I love Ollie saying what he said at"
"The half. ""We're a second-half team too. No backing down. Love his attitude."
"There's no way Kentucky is winning this Nat'l Championship with Julius Randle taking just 3 shots. #Blasphemy"
"<at>Tuanzilla <at>SweetUKGirl He damn sure looks like it"
"Smart of Ollie to delay UConn's pressure . He knows he can't rely on his bench in the second half. He's saving Napier for the end"
"Flop damnit. Flop. Terrible call vs. Poytress"
"Kentucky literally throwing away this game."
"UNTIL that Dunk by Young. Wow!!"
"Good point <at>RealSkipBayless. I can't deny that. But your boys are still losing. Haven 'to had a lead yet"
"Why can't college kids have jump ball"
"And how many damn times do I have to say get the ball away from Napier. Let anyone else beat you"
"Btw....in case anyone hasn't noticed, anyone feeling the need to cuss or call me out my name is instantly blocked. Grow up. Let's talk ball."
"13-of-23 from Free Throw line. If Kentucky loses this game , that'll be a big reason why. But I'll give Napier and Boatright most of credit."
"Yo <at>RealSkipBayless I told you this would come down to the wire. We'll see who shows up."
"Someone should kidnap Napier right now. Tie his shoelaces together. Spike his drink, his towel. Something! Just don't let him shoot"
"Kentucky blew this in the last minute if this game. Sorry, but they didn't seem prepared. They just didn't"
"Congrats <at>RealSkipBayless. Ya got this one"
"Congrats to my man Kevin Ollie, too. Well-deserved. My bad. Never , ever, bet against superior guard play. Randle barely had the ball."

"I struggled to hear Bruce with that outfit on and that bow tie, but his analysis is on point. Can't question the 3-time champion."
"He's talking too long though. Taking time away from my man <at>RealSkipBayless. Haaaa, who am I to talk, right!"
"Loving what I'm seeing from Deron Williams in this game. But not nearly as much as I'm loving listening my boy <at>RyanRuocco call it with PJ."
"I don't care what anyone says, it's totally wrong for the ref to call that. <at>RyanRuocco, tell PJ I Love'em, but give Vasquez a break there."
"Damnit! D-Will froze up at the free-throw line. Come on D-Will. Come on. You better than that, as my man <at>RyanRuocco will gladly admit"
"A 3-pt play to DeRozan right now. Really? Really? How are the Raptors looking like the experienced bunch and the Nets are looking panicked!"
"The one good thing about being sick and stuck at home is that I haven't missed a minute of these last few games.   Wash/Chi is beautiful"

"Long time no speak <at>msglynis1. Hope you're well."

"The <at>HoustonRockets have 12 minutes to decide do the want to make this a playoff series or do the want to get swept."
"Mo Williams is looking like he's back in Cleveland with LeBron. During the regular season, of course"
"But seriously, Mo Williams is BALLIN. I'm proud if this brother. And again, Lillard is at it. He'll deserve that $100 mil Adidas Deal"
"Jeremy Lin...what the hell were you thinking????? Why would you attempt that layup when you could've held the ball.#Brainlock"
"Where the hell was that foul for  <at>DwightHoward. He was mugged by Aldridge on that 1st play of OT"
"Now Jeremy Lin gets stripped. Turnover. Damn ! Damn! Damn!"
"Great hustle by Lin there. Then the pass to Daniels. Can Gundy may not know his name but we all know he can shoot."
"<at>JimmieLeeS Damn"
"<at>ARBernard Amen sir.  See you soon."
"Everyone pump your damn breaks and calm down. Is it Monday yet? Damn! I'll respond to Mr. Donald Sterling's diatribe  when I return. #Wait"
"I just saw/heard the Sterling clip on TMZ 5 min ago. If it's real, all I'll say is this: My God I can't wait to get back to work on Monday."
"Y'all wanted me to talk Donald Sterling. You got me . Turn on SPORTSCENTER within next 8 min"
"Appreciate the love from you <at>KevinHart4real as always bro. Stay up. You know I will."
"Finally, I'm feeling well enough to work again. Gotta get my strength back. Part I: Green Smoothies. Part 2: get in shape w/  <at>obi_obadike"

"<at>gwfmortgage Pretty sure we don't."
"<at>TJB26 <at>LAClippers <at>DocRivers <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>Chris_Broussard We explained earlier today. If you didn't listen that's your problem."

"No hangover bro,<at>Mrhowudodatdere. I don't really drink. 2-drink max, and that's in the off season. Even lighter during the season"

"I'm just tweeting to make sure my man <at>RealSkipBayless is okay. Can't believe Dallas passed on Manziel. This is getting bad. Manziel is Geno"
"Lovely seeing one of my best friends in the world on twitter. Ladies and Gentlemen, meet <at>dsmotivation. My friend of childhood."
"Congratulations my man, <at>1SteveBurton <at>jasonandsam <at>shalenasmith. All the best to you. Not hurry up and get the hell back to GH. Please!"

"The convo with me and Dr. Dyson was necessary and long overdue. No matter your belief, so long as it's thoughtful, we all learn from this."
"About to be on Anderson Cooper right now, except not with AC. The one-and-only Wolf Blitzer is filling in. Check out CNN right now."

"<at>RoyalheartF <at>CNOTEZ are you really trying to say with a straight face that it's wrong to say it's time for us to stop fighting one another?"
"<at>HHConservative Appreciate it but don't need it. I'm comfortable with my position and I'm not budging one inch"
"The fact that you would say I said that shows 1 of 2 things about you , AWills07 <at>RayRice27. You don't comprehend English or it a liar. !"
"Watching this game, the Spurs could be in huge trouble if they don't figure out how to deal with combo of Ibaka and Adams"
"Good Lawd. That stroke from <at>KDTrey5  is too sweet for words. And Tony Parker looks as if he's scared to make a play vs <at>russwest44. Damn!"
"<at>Alex_Nemec haaaaa"
"Wow! What an explosion. OKC has 20 assists and only 6 TO's. And <at>russwest44 is playing lights out. We ourselves a Western Conference Finals."
"It's 8 minutes left in the 3rd QT and Indiana has just 37 points. How much more pathetic can you be!"
"What a Bigtime performance by Paul George. Sensational. What we've been waiting for all-season-long."
"Stupid play by Hill. All he had to do was hold the damn ball. Attempting a contested layup at that point serves no purpose"
"<at>coreyd23 <at>ESPN_FirstTake Haaaaa"
"<at>bryanaschwartz Amen"

"FYI.....First Take is on ESPNews until tennis is over. Then we switch back to ESPN2."
"We're back on ESPN2 right now. Finals' prediction on the way"
"<at>_bigdez_ what numbers are you talking about. I had a grand total of 1 wrong Finals pick until the Lakers messed me up in 2010. Rough since!"
"Who the hell said that <at>Newton_Heels. No one call <at>mcuban that. I just said he needs to be careful. Stop the damn lying"
"<at>SteveHit9434 Thanks for the kind words"
"About to come on SPORTSCENTER right now. Ofcourse <at>ESPN_FirstTake is on the way at the top of the hour"
"<at>SteveDashOh Thank you"
"<at>AndyThewood1220 <at>MrPullNoPunchz <at>ESPN_FirstTake Whatever!"
"You've got to be kidding me. Hear done in by the damn AC system. Now I've seen it all"
"I'm back in the house. And I harbor no responsibility for what <at>RealSkipBayless will say about <at>KingJames with his hatin' self. Buckle up!"
"Chillin in San Antonio, but just wanted to take a moment to send out a prayer for <at>RealTracyMorgan following accident this AM. #GodBless."
"Whoa! Cotto 3 knockdowns in the 1st Round. Martinez badly hurt. Cotto left hook."
"Hey, Cotto looks superb. His defense. Power. Left hook. I don't have Cotto losing 1-single round yet thru the first 8. #MayweatherCotto2"
"Make that 9-0 thru nine rounds. And I don't want to hear anything about Martinez' knee. He's getting annihilated."
"Martinez trainer throws in the towel. It's over. Cotto by TKO."
"A quick break in the action? Here's something for y'all from <at>RealSkipBayless and myself."
"Yes. Unfortunately,  I know you won't :-)"
"Yes! I do have. New commercial. This time: Beats By Dre. Check it out: https://t.co/H9uCyAt4uP"
"Haaa! Haaaa! Check out the <at>ESPN_FirstTake remix for the top of the show today in Miami: http://t.co/w35ZsoIfId"
"I'm totally shocked by how Miami just didn't show up to play tonight. Leonard outplayed everyone, but Mia also got NOTHING from Chalmers."
"Heard all the noise over my saying <at>carmeloanthony &amp; <at>KingJames could pair-up someday. Enough! Read and learn: http://t.co/4RjoyMiXZV"
"For those who don't know, <at>ESPN_FirstTake is only on for an hour today, and it's on ESPNews -- not ESPN2"
"Mia looks terrible on offense. Not moving the ball. Forcing passes when they do. On D, doubling unnecessarily. Just out of sync"
"I am stunned at the way the Heat are looking right now. They keep this up, it's over by Sunday. Hey! At least I'd be home by Monday."
"Ladies/Gentlemen, what we are witnessing is a good ole fashion ass whipping (excuse my language). D-Wade has no legs. LBJ looks exhausted"
"I'll admit it right now: I dropped the ball. Mia looks totally gassed. Out of shape. The Spurs are accustomed to running out West. It shows."
"Yes I do.  And I don't care"
"On ESPN Radio (98.7FM) in NYC from 1-3pm today w/o my man. <at>RyanRuocco. I'm all by my lonesome. But the LOVE DR. Will join in:) 800.919.3776"
"The Love Dr has been requested again. He's up next on ESPN NY (98.7FM). <at>Oprah or <at>OWNTV may not show enough love to is men, but I'm here :)"
"<at>teddysanders1 Thank You my man. I really do need it"
"This flight from Miami on <at>AmericanAir is just disgraceful. Sitting on the plane for 2 hours. Paperwork hasn't arrived! Just damn ridiculous"
"No, I am not on my way yet <at>AmericanAir. I'm told we'll leave shortly........for the 10th time now"
"Whew! If y'all are not watching this Djokovic/Federer match, turn the damn channel. Get in front if a TV. It's special right now."
"Match is back and forth but Federer looks potent when charging the Net. But this IS Djokovic he's going against here, who's winning, btw."
"Djokovic has broken Federer's serve 3 straight times."
"<at>ContendaGOTEM watch First Take and SPORTSCENTER tomorrow and find out"
"Don't y'all dear start asking me questions about <at>KingJames &amp; <at>carmeloanthony. Me and <at>RealSkipBayless r back tomorrow on <at>ESPN_FirstTake"

"What a comeback by Federer. 1 minute he looks old and worn, next minute he's roaring back from 3-down. Unbelievable, win, lose , or draw."
"<at>The_Real_KO Don't get me started with that. Still pissed. Almost ruined my vacation"
"<at>mffl41 <at>ESPN_FirstTake I'm back tomorrow morning. Will be all over the air on both radio and TV. Stay Tuned"
"<at>EdwardSharpe6 What up!"
"<at>I_am_kountry <at>ESPN_FirstTake And we miss y'all."
"<at>SMBN239 <at>ESPN_FirstTake Evidently, you don't know me since you even asked such a ridiculous question"
"<at>SirrLao couldn't watch ever game. But watched USA beat Ghana, then let Renaldo burn them. Loved Columbia and Brazil. Netherlands is legit."
"<at>MikeFSU10 Thanks"
"<at>von_mostwanted Thank you"
"<at>matthertz Thank you for acknowledging how ignorant you are. I've broken too many stories in my career for such a dumb statement. #Goodbye."
"<at>oniellch Hell No! Wait damnit."

"<at>idrisvsmith1 So is mine :-)"
"<at>A2K4Life Why is sourcing nonsense when it comes to sports but you accept it from folks covering politics, where our lives are influenced?"
"<at>please_12OK it is so"
"<at>MattPagg <at>KingJames <at>carmeloanthony <at>RealSkipBayless <at>ESPN_FirstTake What about him"
"<at>DarkoStateNews Fiction"
"<at>KingLebron10 No ! What will help Tennis most is am American male becoming Federer or Djokovic"
"<at>Dg21 none of your business"
"<at>JordanMWilhite Thank you. Sincerely"
"My plan was to wait for <at>ESPN_FirstTake in the AM. But <at>SportsCenter has called me for duty. Here I come. Approx 11:30pm. Buckle Up!"
"Or probably on a few minutes earlier."
"On in 5 minutes, gents. <at>SportsCenter. Check it out."
"Less than 20 min away from SHOWTIME. <at>ESPN_FirstTake is baaaaaccckkkk! ESPN2 at 10am. Holla!"
"I'm sorry folks. I hate having to go off on Josh Gordon like that. But the brother is special/Bigtime. It sickens me to see him do this."
"Neither myself nor anyone can help him by giving him a pass. I want him to have a great career but he's got to clean up his damn act."
"Just 20 min away from hitting the radio waves with my man <at>RyanRuocco on ESPN Radio (98.7FM) in NYC. Call-in# 800.919.3776. Holla!"
"Get the hell up and get ready. Your boy is back in the house on ESPN Radio (98.7 FM) in NY.  800.919.3776. #HollaAtYourBoyyyyyyyyss"
"For those who missed me talking about NBA free agency on ESPN Radio today, here ya go: http://t.co/0YNuaNDCwg"
"<at>1truseatlefan Turn the damn channel then. Nobody asked your $&amp;<at> to watch. Bye!"
"<at>jsprinkles Holla at me when you get a chance. Need to rap about something"
"Nothing in the world can ruin my day today. My man <at>MauriceBenardMB from General Hospital came on <at>ESPN_FirstTake today. I'm in HEAVEN.  Haa"
"<at>MaxxWavy Thanks bro. Appreciate the love"
"<at>GeorgeXjr4 <at>MauriceBenardMB That might work"
"I am at the ESPY's y'all. And I don't care what anyone says: Drake is freaking hilarious. Skits with Blake Griffin/ Imitating Pacquaio#Haaa"
"Can't believe all this nonsense about Tony Dungy. Check out. <at>ESPN_FirstTake right now"
"I'm gonna repeat right here what I just said on <at>ESPN_FirstTake: I do NOT have a problem with what Tony Dungy said. For a couple of reasons:"
"A.) Dungy's quote stated the obvious. Some folks wouldn't touch Sam because they, essentially, know their locker room and could do w/o it."
"B.) from a religious perspective, he's been consistent on his views. Period."
"Again, I've always been an adversary of Gay Prejudice. No room in our society for it. But that doesn't mean someone can't express Dungy's"
"Sentiments. It's life. We've got to deal with it. We'll continue to learn and grow"
"<at>jesusjunkey And you're sending this to me because????????"
"<at>Python490 Please tell us why oh ignorant one."
"<at>GrafixJoker <at>RyanRuocco Keep listening."
"<at>HePharreal Damn right. Luck is a bad boy."
"<at>jquinlan24 Yeah! But he was cognizant enough to pick JACKIE, as opposed to a host of others who were deemed more qualified as players."
"<at>JackHerer16 <at>RealSkipBayless Get over it."
"<at>gotham_city2355 Now you're learning."
"<at>bretta45 Good. So go and get me a commercial, or a new movie deal."
"<at>JessiejNelson Thank you so much for your kind words"
"<at>mettajoshkatz Does your ignorant self have something else to complain about. You argument is old."
"Uh oh! <at>RealSkipBayless in a different kind of mood today. Must be <at>KingJames or <at>JManziel2. I'll try to keep him calm on <at>ESPN_FirstTake"
"<at>3letterman <at>RyanRuocco Amen"
"Just to re-cap my thoughts for today: I'd NEVER forgive Conseco if I were McGwire. And <at>KingJames is right to get his $$$ when teams are"
"in the NBA are being sold for $2-Billion. If owners can get their money, why are players always being asked to take a pay cut."
"<at>colewagoner Doesn't mean I deserve to be asked to take less than my market value."
"Of course we know the reasons, <at>jamesblair06. That ain't the point. The point is: There's always something limited players' compensation."
"<at>blacksamoan300 Damn right!"
"<at>RealRickSanders I'm totally damn disgusted. How the hell do you think I feel about it."
"That's a good point, <at>jamesblair06. But a predictable one. The system was designed for that scenario and the NBPA agreed. Still isn't right"
"So let me get this straight <at>theRealRudyLara. The Brothers should be happy with what they're getting? Even if they're worth more? #Hmmmm"
"<at>Alford908 False."
"Don't forget why players will look bad <at>razzell2. It's because the public has been convinced they're bad b/c they should be THANKFUL.#Sad"
"<at>HammerTime1387 Perhaps you're dumber for even responding."

"Answer me this one question, <at>wideopeninc. Do you want someone else hurt? Think big picture for a damn change."
"Y'all better go someplace with y'all nonsense. Brown was shot. The officer needs to be pay. But I agree with POTUS. All sides needed 2 chill"
"Y'all don't like that position. Too damn bad."
"No it was not, <at>PhilipMurphy95. I know he was unarmed and shot. I know the protestors were peaceful. But why the hell did POTUS speak up???"

"TD denied on review"
"Perfect throw on 2nd down by Thompson. That pass has to be caught. Btw.....it's just the first QT, but the Aggies D already looks better."
"Kenny Hill has got athleticism, too. He can evade pressure and run with the football. Plain and simple."

"Are y'all ready for some Football? <at>ESPN_FirstTake is. We're in the house at the top of the hour on ESPN2. Holla!"
"Just 30 min away. Day 3 of the new Stephen A. Smith Show on SiriusXM MadDog Radio (Channel 85). Time for some F-Ball. 888.MadDog6."
"Man, Beast Mode is running all over these dudes. If GB doesn't figure out Lynch this is gonna be a long, long night"
"Oh shut the hell up <at>cartelfatal. Are the CowGirls playing tonight? Mind your damn business and watch the game. You wish Dallas had Rodgers."
"<at>OldGuysRule01 we both picked Seattle to win this game"
"Damn. Rodgers had the first down and threw it away. Plus, I really have a problem with not one pass being thrown <at>RSherman_25 way. #Damn!"
"Weak call against Brad Jones. Sacked turned into a 1st down. As if Seattle needs additional help. Jesus!"
"<at>kajundiva21 if you always agreed with me, what kind of show would it be"
"<at>JoeBOBaHead Their defense is suspect. They'll still win the NFC North though"
"<at>chad_patrick Please do. I promise I won't miss ya"
"<at>mikellie2 I don't have to WISH anything. Been getting paid to do it for 2 decades. While you follow my every move. Get a damn life."
"Big stops by GB at end of half, then start of second half. Seattle could've had the game rapped up by now if GB's D had folded. They didn't"
"So much for that notion. A-Rod was at fault there. Bad pass to Jordy Nelson"
"Beast Mode on the way"
"GB's off line can't handle this pass rush.  Bennett? Williams? Doesn't matter, especially with Bulaga out and Sherrod getting abused.#Over!"
"Day 4 of the new Stephen A. Smith Show on SiriusXM MadDog Sports Radio (channel 85) is about to begin right now. Call in: 888.MadDog6."
"Wth! Redskins special teams a disaster again? Damn! Ya know what: just give the ball to Morris and call it a day. Texans can't stop him."
"It's just a matter of time before my man <at>RealSkipBayless sees Johnny Football. Cleveland's offense looks awful"
"I can't believe how awful the Eagles have been. Can't hold onto the ball. Can't protect Foles. Who are these dudes !"
"I know Foles can't only do but so much with backups protecting him on the OL, but Still. Come on!"
"WTH. I leave for a second and what do I return to: actual games taking place in Philly, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Baltimore, afterall. Yes!"
"Not the Pittsburgh part, though. Can't have my Steelers losing today"
"Can't wait for my shows tomorrow. Eagles, Steelers, Falcons, Patriots and, ofcourse, this owner for the Atlanta Hawks. Just can't wait."
"Aaaahhhhhh haaaaa! Accidents waiting to happen. Ahhhhaaaaa! How 'Bout Them Cowboys. Hhaaaa haaaa. They/Romo just never let me down. #Whew!!!"
"Props to the caller into my SiriusXM MadDog Radio Show last week who said: ""They're not the DALLAS Cowboys. They're the DELUSIONAL Cowboys!"

"That's the number to call. Not a damn soul is hiding this way. Let's see who has to courage to call up and make some damn sense instead of"
"of being juvenile, engaging in name-calling and all this other ignorance. I double damn dare you to call up. 888.MadDog6. 
I'LL-BE-WAITING!"
"And please be clear: I'm encouraging BLACK folks to call on this issue. I'm sick and damn tired of us attacking one another just because"
"someone isn't ready to protest and call for someone white to be fired. Enough already. Obviously, i'm not talking about ALL or MOST of us."
"just the ignorant damn few. And you know who the hell you are. I'll be on the air at 1pm. SiriusXM MadDog Radio, Channel 85. # 888.623.3646"
"As if I wasn't pissed off enough, now the National Organization For Woman is calling for Roger Goodell's Resignation. $&amp;<at> Ridiculous. Oohhhh"
"I can't get to SiriusXM soon enough to do my radio show. I can't believe this. Talk to ya'll at 1pm. SiriusXM MadDog Radio (Channel 85)."
"Let's be clear: I specifically said Goodell should not have to resign ABSENT any evidence that he saw the rice' tape months earier. #UhOh!"
"Goodell cancels public appearance in Charlotte. League does not emphatically deny they received video back in April.#AwwwDamn!"
"Another edition of the new Stephen A. Smith Show on SiriusXM MadDog Radio (Channel 85). Rice, Steelers/Ravens, Paul George. 888.MadDog6."
"It's coming your way RIGHT NOW"
"<at>HendersonNikcoy maybe. I have no idea"
"<at>real_CDrunker how is it racist? I'm saying what Cam shouldn't say to another Brotha. Maybe you think that way b/c it's how you really feel."

"<at>SeaBobNumbas Sometimes it is"
"<at>BreakNboxes I didn't question the intent. I said I didn't like it. Period"
"<at>Real_illyWitIt no sir. Just was blessed with 2 eyes and 20/20 vision"
"<at>johnnnyo666 If players never talked to Media you'd never hear what they thought or how they feel....unless their PR folks are enough!"
"I can tell you one thing about my show today on SiriusXM <at>MadDogRadio: we will NOT be talking about Ray Rice. Steelers/Ravens, other NFL gms"
"The NFL's new drug policy and Cam Newton comments about Suh are on my mind"
"Time into the new Stephen A. Smith Show on SiriusXM <at>MadDogRadio (channel 85) at the top of the hour. 888.Maddog 6. That's 888.623.3646"
"That was not a damn holding penalty on #54 for Georgia. Should've been a TD for Gurley. Weak call by officials"
"Good TD pass by Hudson Mason. Damn good game. Just find myself feeling like neither GA nor SC will make much noise this season"
"You're not looking at the big pic <at>Jayncs. It's not about Ferry. It's about opening the box you don't wanna open. Ever think about what WE"
"Say behind closed doors <at>Jayncs. If you're gonna be quick to get someone FIRED over that, where the hell does that leave US! #THINK"
"<at>CHAZ2923 none of your damn business :-)"
"<at>DavidDirecttv Amen! I am not a fan of that coach"
"2 different things <at>Gregory305. Ferry made a mistake. Sterling revealed he views himself as a plantation owner. Check the facts"
"Ya know what: I think I'm gonna give y'all a round-by-round critic of the Mayweather demolition tonight! Stay Tuned!!!"
"To be quite honest with y'all, I'm yawning already. If Maidana TOUCHES his face I'll be pleasantly shocked. Expect a boxing exhibition."
"Mayweather moves and moves. Relatively boring round with nothing more than a Skip from Floyd. Maidana stalks though. #floydRound1"
"Floyd is running a bit more than usual. Will admit that"
"Maidana catches Floyd with a couple of looping shots. Floyd gets ticked off. Unloads check hooks and straight rights. Floyd wins Round 2"
"Oh Damn! Maidana catches Floyd with a  hard round to end around 3. Caught him. Floyd wins Round 3 but was dazed for a second"
"Yes, I'm admitting it. Floyd got hit in the face."
"Round 4. Maidana is on the attack. Floyd is getting hit. What the hell is he doing???????"
"Okay, Floyd looks to be employing the rope a dope. Jabs to the body to set up the right. Maidana wins round though. Getting very interesting"
"Floyd moving. Hitting with jabs, counter punches and straight shots. Maidana answering with double l-hooks. Floyd wins round but is tired!"
"He can't breath after taking that shot to the nose is Round 4"
"Floyd wins Round 7. Left ear and mouth seems to be bleeding and Floyd looks to be fatigued. Getting in the corner too much. Maidana stalks"
"Whoa! Fight stalled with 19sec left in Round 8....Maidana BITES Floyd. Round goes to Zfloyd"
"Floyd wins Round 9, but basically by default. Both are missing. Floyd looks slower and heavier than usual. But did connect a couple times"
"Maidana docked pt for throwing Floyd to canvas. He's swinging wildly but missing mostly. Floyd is just too elusive for this dude."
"Floyd wins Round 11. Same ole same ole"
"I had Maidana winning 1 round, which was Round 4....aside from being given Round 12 because Floyd simply stayed away."
"I applaud Floyd for acknowledging he deserved a C-minus grade for his performance. He didn't have it. He was slow. He could be better. And.."
"He will be for Manny Pacquaio . Book it. It's coming. Mark my words."
"Floyd needs to stop showing everyone his hand. We know he got bite, but it wasn't his ear. Plus, his nose and lip got busted. #ugh"

"I don't know every player personally <at>D_TrillHendrixx. I just know who I know."
"<at>chuccamg no way."
"My thing is: I'm so disappointed with how the Wizards ended this season. They have the talent. They should beat Toronto. But why believe?"
"Vasquez cannot guard John Wall. Wall should have a field day."
"Good 3 by Pierce. He needs to show up in this series with all the talking he's done. But I believe he will. Let's see what Wall and Beal do!"
"<at>IpayneI I picked Dallas in 6"
"That's not my concern with the Clips <at>SJYbarra77. My concern is there FT shooting. That's why I picked the Spurs."

"<at>Trollteller nope"
"<at>TrendsToronto I'm suppose to trend WorldWide Bro :-)"
"Why <at>StatandMelo1? What happened? What did he do?"
"Keep in mind, I picked Toronto to win this series, but here's a huge problem it has: Wall can hold Lowry in check. That's a huge problem."
"Paul Pierce is putting on a show. Meanwhile, Toronto has not adjusted to Wizards smaller lineup and they are not hitting perimeter shots."
"Raptors starting to penetrate into teeth of Wizards D. Here they come. But Beal also needs to play better. If he does, Wizards grab Game 1"
"It's the 4th QT and the Raptors, one of the top offenses in the game, doesn't even have 60 pts. Is this about their offense or Wizards' D?"
"<at>blazianpride 50/50. I think they'll get to the Conf. Finals"
"<at>bburack16 No Sir."
"<at>lewis80jamall Actually this ain't the day to say that. He's backing it up"
"Uh-Oh. 13-2 run"
"Crucial call vs. Amir Johnson. Bogus call at tis point, negating Lou Willis' 3. Could cost Toronto the game"
"Wizards can't play as well as they've played then lose this game. A loss will be devastating"
"Great move by Beal. Got Lowry out the game. Toronto's in trouble. Not that they weren't already of course. Not a good game for Lowry"
"What a Game. Wizards almost blew it. Looking good right now, though"
"A loss is a loss. But no way in Hell should Toronto go scoreless in OT."
"Beautiful day at the crib. Watching this Warriors/Pelicans game while getting a massage from the best in the business. Andrea: 856.396.7554"

"A few rounds, the knuckles wear through the padding in the gloves, more so than with GRANT or EVERLAST. That means his already hard punches"

"Job he did with Peyton Manning....who established his greatness 15 yrs b4 Gase ever stepped onto the scene? Really? I tell you, man......."

"See what I'm saying. Clemson TD. At least they stopped the 2-point conversion, though. Now Bama MUST not give ball back.#championshiptake"
"I agree with Herbstreit about McKenzie Alexander. That play to Howard wouldn't have happened if he were in the game.#championshiptake"

"Can't coach what ya simply don't have!"
"Whoa! Kyle Lowry just pulled yo damn near from the parking lot to make a contested 3-pointer. Raptors"
"TiVo'd the Nicholas Walters/Lomachenko fight. What a disgrace. After all that talking by Walters, he QUIT. Wasn't even hurt. Just QUIT!"
"Walters should have his purse withheld. With all that knockout power, there's always a chance, despite the fact he was getting schooled."
"You don't quit. Especially when you're a champion. Amazing how someone's ego can ultimately work against them and make them crumble."
"Walters explanation: He wasn't active, plus he was hurt. So it would be silly to come out in 8th Round. What a disgrace.#Embarrassing"
"<at>Th3BadGuy No excuse to QUIT"

"Are you kidding me? Now Puig hits a HR with one hand. 2-run shot. It’s now 12-11. I can’t! I just can’t!"
"Tie Game. Taylor single up middle. Guess that means HOUSTON wins at bottom of inning because <at>Dodgers have no pitching left. They’re spent!"

"Oh My Damn! <at>sixers outscored 47-15 by <at>warriors in the 3rd QT. Lord Have Mercy!"
"Watching the end of this <at>ChicagoBears vs <at>Lions game. Snap? Perfect! Hold? Perfect! Kick by Connor Barth? Beyond atrocious. Waaaaay wife right. Wasted damn-good closing drive by Trubisky. So sad how kickers can ruin a game."
"Not surprised at all the <at>Vikings beat the <at>RamsNFL either. Their defense is big time. <at>RamsNFL offense? I needed to see them against a defense like this to believe. Came in w/ questions about Rams &amp; left w/ them, too."
"As for the <at>Redskins I figured they’d show up today and play. Nobody’s thinking about them, so there’s no pressure. They wait for expectations to actually wet the bed and disappoint you."
"Although <at>Saints just scored another TD and pulled within 31-29. Now they need the 2-pt conversion"
"The GREAT Drew Brees is 11-for-11 on last two drives after <at>Saints trailed 31-16 with under 5 min left. Now they’ve scored on 2-pt conversion. Game tied 31-31. Let’s see what <at>Redskins do now."
"Now <at>Saints can’t get a stop when they need it. <at>Redskins in field goal range to win it. <at>Saints’ defense? Who Dat!"
"Intentional grounding by Kirk Cousins. WTH! Cost <at>Redskins 10 yards and 10. Stupid mistake by Cousins, who’s been otherwise great today. We’re going to OT, y’all"
"<at>Giants beat <at>Chiefs in OT. Alex Smith and that offense was awful today. And in case y’all are missing this, <at>buffalobills bench Tyrod for a 5th-Round Rookie (Petersen), who’s already thrown 2 INT’s. Looking bad for them right now."
"Ingram is running all over the <at>Redskins right now. They’re either worn out or simply can’t stop him. Gruden looks lost on the sidelines. Understood. <at>Saints just won the game. As great as Cousins was, couldn’t stop bleeding when it counted."
"BTW......<at>Redskins are officially done, for all of you who were wondering."
"Osweiler just flung a football into middle of the field w/looking. Lucky it wasn’t intercepted. Dude is so lucky. I see certain guys in this league QBing, and it just makes me think more about <at>Kaepernick7. <at>KingJames knows he’s blackballed like rest of us."
"The <at>buffalobills’ rookie QB — who Tyrod Taylor was benched for — has thrown 3 Int’s in his first 9 passes, all in the First Quarter. Experiment/Risk by McDermott isn’t looking go good right now"
"My bad. Petersen has FOUR — Yes, 4 — interceptions for the Bills. I know he’s just a rookie, but if you’re going to bench Tyrod Taylor, it doesn’t need to be for someone who’s doing things we haven’t seen done since 2002."
"What a disastrous day for the the <at>buffalobills. Petermen’s FIVE interceptions and subsequent benching leaves McDermott with an awful lot of explaining to do. The <at>RAIDERS disastrous tendencies need to be addressed to"
"Perhaps someone can explain to me how the <at>Patriots are suppose to have this awful defense — although it’s improved — and yet <at>derekcarrqb and the <at>RAIDERS can’t score a single damn point? What has happened to these guys?"
"H Lord. Brock Osweiler has the ball, needing to go 80 yards for a <at>Broncos win or about 45 to 50 yards for a tying FG. Why is it that I have ZERO faith in him?"
"4-and-out! No doubt adding insult to the loss, Vontaze Burfict goes over and hugs Osweiler after he flops, as if to say: “Thank You Brock....for being YOU.”Damn!!!"
"Btw.......I know Osweiler and Burfict are friends. Wasn’t speaking to Burfict’s intent. Just that folks who may not know they’re friends may have looked at it differently, because of how little Osweiler is thought of"

"Yep. The <at>Eagles look as if they’re about to pull away. The score here and it’s a wrap. Remember: <at>AtlantaFalcons don’t win games when they don’t score 20 or more. Matt Ryan will need to come up with something."
"Not Matt Ryan’s daily on that last play. Julio Jones falls down. 4th &amp; Goal on the 2-Yard line with a playoff game on the line....you look for your best guy first. Falling down happens. But if you’re Julio, you just can’t let that happen to you. Game over!"
"Damn! Damn! Damn! Big Ben intercepted AGAIN by <at>Jaguars. Damn!"
"And BTW......hey Mike Mitchell, where are you? Ya see why you don’t look ahead to the <at>Patriots??? Sh&amp;$! Game might be over already. Damn!!!!"
"What in the hell are the <at>steelers doing?? Why are they running sweeps against a defense with this speed? You’re less than a yard away. How about a QB sneak? Or to LeVeon right up the middle? Damn!!"
"Why is Mike Mitchell even talking to Leonard Fournette. Better yet: why don’t the <at>Jaguars just give Fournette the ball? It’s not like the damn <at>steelers can stop him. I can’t believe how disappointing this is. I’m so disgusted."
"I’m a damn <at>steelers fan an I’m telling you I cannot believe how much they are getting clubbed. This is an ASS WHIPPING right now. I’m almost ready to turn off my television."

"Okay! Okay! I like that TD to LeVeon from Big Ben. But it doesn’t mean a damn thing if the <at>steelers’ defense doesn’t figure out how to stop Fournette and the <at>Jaguars’ offense. What’s up Mike Mitchell? Let’s Go!"
"Yep. 28 of the <at>Jaguars’ 35 points came from their offense. But Mike Mitchell wants us to believe this defense is guaranteed to go to Foxborough and beat the <at>Patriots. #ChildPlease"
"Now <at>steelers’ D...whatcha gonna do? Man-The-Hell-Up! Stop somebody! Damn!!!!"
"This is officially embarrassing. The <at>steelers defense has given up 35 of 42 pts to a BLAKE BORTLES offense. You see why you needed to keep quiet <at>iammikemitchell? Even if you play well, you can’t speak for everybody. 35 Damn points! Boy do I long for the days of STEEL CURTAIN!"
"These <at>steelers. Can’t even do an on-side kick right. I personally had no problem with the attempt — even if you do have two timeouts left — but MY GOODNESS. Boswell can’t do an on-side kick right? Ridiculous."
"This was a disgraceful performance by the <at>steelers’ defense. They never - ever - showed up. And I’m driving this right in the lap of Mike Mitchell who, at least, APPEARED to look right past the <at>Jaguars. Trust is point to #’s all day but the <at>steelers haven’t had smite D in yrs"
"The <at>steelers totally looked past the <at>Jaguars. And the defense is responsible. Big Ben showed up, despite mistakes. <at>AB84 showed. <at>LeveonbeII showed up. But their defense didn’t. No Steel Curtain in the Steel City. That’s what happened."
"Great kick by Forbath. Kudos! But 1:29 is plenty of time for Drew Brees to get <at>Saints in FG Range. No.2 offense vs. No.1 Defense. Im<at>nervous but I believe in Brees!!!"
"Yeah! Like I said: I BELIEVE in Drew Brees. No matter what happens over these last 25 seconds, he did his job!!!!"
"This mistake by Marcus WILLIAMS — missing that play on Stefon Diggs — May be the absolute WORST MISTAKE I’ve ever seen in NFL Post-Season History. If it’s not THE worst it’s certainly up there. All the man had to do is make a tackle and the game is over. Horrible, Horrible Error."

"This <at>Twolves vs <at>nuggets game is fantastic. Jokic is simply something special. But Towns is getting his too. Jeff Teague has stepped up with a couple of Big 3’s. Let’s see how this ends."
"Right now Towns is too emotional. <at>Nuggets just need to play through Jokic. He’s scoring from everywhere, plus he’s savvy enough to fouls KAT out of there. Stupid for Denver to go through anyone else right now."
"Plus, Jokic has made his last four 3-pt attempts. Jimmy Butler just missing two FT’s didn’t help Minny. And now this kid Murray just pulled up for a 3. It’s 99-99 with 2:51 left.#LovingThis"
"Horrible possession by <at>nuggets with chance to take the lead. Tried too hard to force it to Jokic on one possession. Next possession he forced underhand scoop. <at>Wolves don’t take advantage b/c of 2 forced ones by Butler. Tied with 4.4 left. Denver Ball."
"Fantastic Defense on Jokic by Taj Gibson, strips Jokic in left corner, maintains possession, calls timeout. Score is tied 101 with 1.6 seconds left. This needs to put AND1 — Jamal Crawford in NOW."
"Crawford launches it from near halfcourt. Launches ill-advised heave. Had enough time to get a better shot. No matter. It’s overtime in Minny"
"I like Barton. But he’s done nothing for <at>nuggets since the first half. It’s looking like Denver missed its chance. But there’s still plenty of time."

"<at>cody_smith0 <at>maxkellerman I honestly don’t think so. I like the thought of <at>KDTrey5 with <at>kawhileonard rather than Kawhi with <at>KingJames. I know LeBron is the best in the world right now, but I don’t like that pair better than KD with Kawhi."

"Ladies &amp; Grntlemen, the great Dan Klores is at it again. To anyone who loves BBall, this is must see. Please don’t miss it: https://t.co/XudPZz4k31"
"We haven’t even had a chance to pass gas yet and already, Brady to Gronk for a TD. Two things: <at>HoustonTexans turnover on first snap inexcusable. But worse, Houston’s defense couldn’t do anything about it. Not good."
"Just watched ELI Manning throw same pass to Odell that he got hurt on last season. Made me nervous."
"Damn! Ryan Fitzpatrick to DeSean Jackson on a bomb for a TD. Jameis better be careful. Job might not be waiting for him once he gets back in this keeps up."
"Btw....helluva catch just made right now by Evan Engram. But a holding penalty brings it bavk"
"On another note, Stefan Diggs sold Richard Sherman on an up-field move, then came back. 19-yard gain. Looked entirely too easy. <at>Vikings not shy about attacking Sherman this far. #Hmmmmmm"
"Big Ben just intercepted by a ROOKIE, Denzel Ward. #F&amp;<at>$"
"Here’s the deal with <at>saquon right now for the <at>Giants: too much damn  tap-dancing. That burst that, say, an <at>EzekielElliott Has is not what I’m seeing thus far. If you’re 233lbs with tree trunks for legs, why the hell do you need to do all that? Hit the hole and go!"
"Uh oh! <at>Mathieu_Era gets tipped interception at <at>Patriots 17-yard line. <at>HoustonTexans in good spot but Watson holding onto ball too long. Plus, at least 3 Texans already hurt in this game; precisely what plagued them last year. Something to watch"
"What the hell is going on with Tampa? Ryan Fitzpatrick just ran in for a TD. Bucs Up 14-10"
"Speaking of TD’s, perfect thrown from Kirk Cousins to Stefon Diggs. Absolutely perfect throw. This is why they guaranteed Cousins $84-mil. Let’s see if it continues"
"I can’t believe I’m saying this but Ryan Fitzpatrick is putting on a show. Is that him and tamp’s receivers? Or is the <at>Saints defense more suspect than we were willing to recognize? Let’s see"
"This <at>steelers offense is looking real suspect in my eyes. Just can’t seem to make anything happen."
"I take it back. James Conner busted WALKED in on a TD run. <at>steelers we’re helped by a roughing the passer penalty, but who gives a damn. I’ll take what I can get. Steelers Up 7-0"
"Patriots go up 14-3. Sick of us acting like there’s some suspense. Screens. Dips &amp; Dunks. To Hogan. To Dorsett. To Gronk. It just doesn’t matter. They’re a well-oiled machine. They just get it done. And the <at>HoustonTexans offense hasn’t done a damn-impressive thing yet."
"DeShaun Watson: 8 drop backs. Sacked once and hurried 5 times."
"Nice throw just now from Watson to Jordan Thomas in 1-on-1 coverage. TE is a big boy. Watson should use him more."
"Another int by Big Ben. Looks like receiver ran wrong route, though. Still, this is what you get when you help run Todd Haley out if town. Too many times, folks act like we’ve got to have Thanksgiving Dinner together or exchange Christmas Gifts to work together. Just do the job!"
"Uh, Hello: Andrew Luck is balling. 14-for-19, 146 yards, 1 TD. He’s back"
"The <at>49ers are in a 1st &amp; Goal situation due to yet another holding penalty vs <at>XavierRhodes29_ . He is BIGTIME, but that’s the one bad part about him that he’s got to fix."
"Doesn’t matter. <at>49ers 14-play drive gone because Alfred Morris gets stripped by Linval Joseph and the 1-yard line. <at>Vikings recover. Defense is still bigtime, showing why they were no.1 last season until the last 6-quarters we saw them in the playoffs."
"Damnit! <at>deshaunwatson just floats the ball into the end zone for an interception. What the hell us going on? Again, <at>HoustonTexans look lost offensively. <at>DeAndreHopkins is nowhere to be found thus far. We’ll see, but totally unimpressive this far"
"Btw.....Jags defense all over the <at>Giants. They can’t seem to do anything right now. ELI a virtual stationary target"
"Gotta admit, I like what I’m seeing from Kirk Cousins. But it IS the regular season, so I won’t sweat it too much"
"Wish I could say I like what I’m seeeing from Big Ben. Bad conditions, plus bad plays fro receivers. But still: Big Ven has 3 But’s in the first half. Not good. That’s just not good!"
"Btw......with the <at>Browns doing absolutely nothing offensively, it’ll be interesting to see if Hue Jackson just says “To Hell With It All” and elects to put in <at>bakermayfield and bench <at>TyrodTaylor. Im<at>not wishing that on Tyrod at all. Just pointing out that ya just never know!"
"WTH is is going on? Ryan Fitzpatrick has let the <at>Buccaneers to 31-First Half points. My goodness!"
"Great touch throw from Joe Flacco to Michael Crabtree, who tap danced in the back of the end zone. <at>Ravens look good, but it’s against the <at>buffalobills - who’s thrown their season but just won’t admit it to the rest of us. Anyone who starts Pederman is doing just that!#AwfulTeam"
"55 points in the scoreboard in the first half of <at>Buccaneers vs <at>Saints. Same ole Saints (No defense. Everything on Drew Brees’ Shoulders). Different Day"
"Manning just had <at>OBJ_3 open — had him matched up vs a safety. But ELI missed him, for the 2nd time today. This keeps up and it’ll be clear that Eli’s the one who has to get it together. Odell speed, etc. is there. Not on him."
"Btw.....Carlos Hyde is running the ball effectively vs <at>steelers, averaging better than 4-yds per carry. But guess what: so is 2nd-round pick, Nick Chubb. We’ll see how this works out."
"Awwwww Damn! <at>TyrodTaylor just rushes from about 20- yards out for a TD. <at>Browns rushed for about 70-damn yards on that drive. These damn Steelers are really annoying me right now."
"Another Fitzpatrick to Evans hookup. <at>Buccaneers down near <at>Saints 5-yard line. Just doing what they want offensively. Saints’ defense looking pathetic right now. Just pathetic."
"Uh Huh! Jimmy G just threw a Pick-6. Receiver DUD fall down, but the throw was getting intercepted anyone because it wasn’t near the receiver, period. I know <at>MollyQerim  won’t want to admit that about her 2nd favorite WB, but it’s absolutely true."
"There is a legitimate chance that this year’s <at>buffalobills may be the WORST NFL team we’ve seen this decade. Forget records (the 0-16teams in Detroit &amp; CLEVELAND in recent memory. I’m not talking record. I’m just saying they are God-Awful. Is there any worse than Peterman?#Lordy"
"No surprises here: the pick-6 off a deflected pass by ELI Manning started with a tackle blowing by RT Erick Flowers. Good Lord! It just never ends with this guy"
"There is a caller into the Stephen A. Smith radio show named “Carlton,” based out of Tampa. There is no bigger fan of Ryan Fitzpatrick that I know of. I can only imagine how he’s feeling right now, with Bucs having now dropped 48pts on Saints — and counting. #LordHaveMercy!"
"Wow! <at>saquon just busted out the gates and ran for a 68-yard TD run. Before this moment, he was only averaging 2.3 yards per carry. Still, a question: he was clearly out of gas after the 68-yarder. So why the hell does Shurmur give the man the ball in the 2-pt conversion?#Idiotic"
"Garrappolo overthrows Kittle from<at>the inside slot. He was open. He missed it. He may be good. This is the <at>Vikings defense. But like I said: he’s no Tom Brady. Let the man prove something first place. Thank you very mich"
"Ummm, something necessary to point out: <at>OBJ_3 has 11 receptions today. 11. I know <at>jalenramsey didn’t say anything about Beckham, but he did say something about the person throwing him the ball: ELI. Still love Ramsey though. Brother is special."
"Botched handle on punt by some dude named Clay finishes off <at>Giants"
"Jimmy Garrappolo gets ball with over a minute and a half left, with a chance to tie, then proceeds to throw the ball RIGHT INTO COVERAGE to Smith for the int. His 3rd INT in the day. Need I say anymore?
He can play. I’m wishing him luck. But I tried to tell y’all: not yet!"
"It’s only his 8th-career start. Shame on all those who tried to act like he’s the 2nd-coming if Brady. Pump the damn brakes."
"Suttton intercepts <at>TyrodTaylor, making up for the touchdown he gave up to Josh Gordon earlier. Btw.....happy as hell to see Gordon catch that TD. So special. Wishing him all the luck. But the <at>steelers had better not lose this game. It’s embarrassing enough GM is in OT."
"Awwww S<at>&amp;$! <at>Chiefs looking prophetic in their praise for <at>PatrickMahomes5. He just connected on a 58-yarder to Tyreek Hill off a slant pattern. Chiefs up 14-3."
"The <at>Browns just got a sack. Are the <at>steelers offensive line going to blame <at>LeVeonBell for that too?? Next point in OT wins this game. Why do I suspect the <at>steelers is going to blow this? If they do, I’ll be looking for my man Ryan Clark tomorrow on <at>FirstTake"
"Gotta say: this kid <at>denzelward has been BALLIN for the <at>Browns all afternoon. I’m thoroughly impressed with this kid. Maybe we should stop talking if waiting for <at>bakermayfield and start paying more attention to this rookie."
"Yep! <at>Earl_Thomas misses all of training camp, practices less than a week, yet steps right in, reads Case Keenum like a book for the int, and sets up <at>Seahawks First TD."
"After that magnificent running from Cam Newton, the drive gets ruined near the goal line because Christian McCaffrey gets stripped. <at>dallascowboys ball."
"Just need to Big Ben hit from behind. Another int. <at>Browns kick FG to win the damn game. I’m sick to my stomach. If the lose this game, it’ll be their largest blown 4th-QT lead in a loss in team history."
"FG blocked. Scored tied with :13 left. I freakin HATE TIES. Play until you drop damnit. Can’t stand this. This is a rule the NFL needs to change. Who gives a damn about a tie? No winners or losers! Sunday afternoon in Cleveland and Pitssburgh just wasted."
"Tyrell WILLIAMS just dropped a wide-open TD pass from Phillip Rivers. He may be some practice squad success story, but if he doesn’t make it for that....that’s exactly where he’ll find himself back to. He’s better hope Rivers throws him the ball again."
"The <at>Panthers have had heat in <at>dak all afternoon. Don’t know why Garrett decides to go for it on 4th &amp; 10...having one of the best punters, plus timeouts. But then again, what do I care. It’s the damn <at>dallascowboys we’re talking about here. Haaaaaaaa!!!!!!!"
"Yep! <at>Panthers did it again. See, this is what we were saying coming into the season: can Dan really handle it when it’s on his shoulders? So far — dating back to last season AND this one — the answer is NO!!!! Hey y’all: How ‘Bout Dem Cowboys!” Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"No place for <at>dak to throw. No place for <at>EzekielElliott to run. And remember folks, I’m being very nice. I didn’t say a word about Randy Gregory😀😀😀😀😀😀😀"
"By the way.....it’s just one week. But I’m willing to go so far as to call <at>Chiefs all-purpose star, Tyreek Hill, THE MOST EXPLOSIVE player in the NFL. He’s THAT soecial"
"Man, I can’t wait to address this subject on First Take tomorrow. What are y’all thoughts? https://t.co/HJLooTzdKc"
"Talking Le'Veon TOMORROW! Was that game further evidence that the Steelers should descend upon Bell and BEG him to come back now? Check out First Take tomorrow when we discuss! https://t.co/ThD35meZ71"
"I’m not laughing when I ask that. Seriously! https://t.co/QRAvgiamo0"
"I’d love to tell you <at>AaronRodgers12 is a baaaaadddddddddd man and that’s that! But that was just a huge lapse on the back-end of <at>ChicagoBears defense. Major collapse. But now let’s see what <at>Mtrubisky10 does. We’re about to find out."
"Public service announcement. https://t.co/oRHWhasFET"
"Over! <at>Mtrubisky10 gets sacked, but not his fault. Nobody was open. But for the record, how many times do I have to tell y’all: <at>AaronRodgers12 is a Baaaaaaaaaddddddddd Man! The GREATEST TD I have ever seen. One of these days, you will all say it with me!"
"<at>DP908 You’re right. I was just too disgusted with the outcome and the Steelers offense to even think about that. But I’ll make sure to mention him later."
"<at>CoachRodTaylor <at>willcain <at>serenawilliams She wasn’t wrong about her passion and her argument. What she was wrong about was bringing sexism into equation because he’s done things to MEN, as well. It diluted her argument by bringing that up. You’ve got to make those accusations COUNT."

"<at>NeilSamra1 <at>52Mack_ <at>rcobb18 I can’t stand your ass, either. How about that? As big as Mack is, did you not see him collapse in the end zone once he missed the tackle? Needed a damn oxygen mask after. But here you are talking about hustle. Sit your ass down :-)"

"Good drive by <at>nyjets. Good throws from Darnold, good runs by Powell and Crowell. If Jets keep this power game going, who knows. Let’s find out what the <at>Lions under Matt Patricia are made of."
"What did y’all just see: Morris Claiborne leap and intercept Matthew Stafford? Or Stafford — one of the highest paid players in the league - reminding you, yet again, that he’s never won a playoff game in his decade-long career?"
"Sam Darnold did go to college for a couple of years, right? How difficult is it to comprehend that you don’t take sacks in the red zone? This is the second tome he’s done it this gane"
"BIGTIME throw by Darnold. He’s 4-for-4 on 3rd Downs. Whoa! Very impressive. Unless you want to look at Patricia and say: yet another Belichick coordinator who won’t pan out"
"Another interception by Matthew Stafford. His 3rd. This time a pick-6. Awful! At some point we’ve got to ask ourselves why in the hell is a QB that’s never win a playoff game getting paid more than $27-mil per. I guess the answer would be: Be a use Kirk Cousins is making $28 mil"
"ANOTHER damn interception. What a God-Awful performance by Stafford. Matt Patricia has to be saying: “I can’t believe I left Tom Brady for this.” He looks completely shook and I don’t blame him. <at>nyjets LB’s are just laying back in coverage, daring Stafford to throw.#Embarrassing"
"This is the kind of performance that should make ALL NFL teams pause at the thought of hiring a Belichick disciple! Patricia’s very first game and this is how they look."
"Gotta admit, that drive by the <at>Raiders was special, especially that finish by Beastmode and that offensive line. That’s the way you start out a new era. That score personifies Gruden. Gotta give credit where is due. Now let’s see how this <at>Raiders Defense does!"

"It’s about that time folks. Who y’all got? <at>Canelo or <at>GGGBoxing. I’ll be chiming in at y’all, hopefully every 2 rounds. Stay locked. I can’t wait for this!"
"Forgot to share this with y’all yesterday: at the weigh-in, <at>GGG did look a little gimpy with his walk. Could be nothing, but I’m watching."
"Hey! <at>GGG round 1 because if his jab. <at>Canelo gets round 2 because of power shots, speed, and the swelling developing in <at>GGG left side of face because of it"
"2-2 after 4. Gave 3rd round to Canelo and 4th to GGG. Jabs. A couple of body shots. And finally pushed Canelo back"
"Yep! <at>GGG gets Round 5. Using jab. <at>Canelo stalking but not connecting. He’s better when he’s countering. Not attacking. At least not yet"
"That’s 3  rounds to 2 for <at>GGGBoxing"
"Round 6 was even. Both got off decent shots. I still say: <at>Canelo is hurting himself by backing up. He’s at his best countering. Not being the aggressor"
"I see what <at>Canelo is doing though. <at>GGG is the older man. Attack the body and hope he wears down"
"I gave <at>Canelo round 7. Power shots early propelled him. But <at>GGG is using that jab. <at>Caneko is trying to do what <at>FloydMayweather did to <at>TheNotoriousMMA: walk him down. Stay in his chest. Take leverage off those shots"
"I give Round 8 to <at>GGG. Less power shots but more jabs and solid shots connected. <at>Canelo cut over left eye. But <at>GGG looks tired"
"I gave <at>Canelo Round 9. Power shots connected. <at>GGG keeps coming. When he uses the jab he’s very effective and <at>Canelo struggles. But other wise <at>Canelo has advabtage"
"Round 10 goes to <at>GGG. Hurt <at>Canelo with right, then a flurry. <at>Canelo started off round strong but faded too much. Now he might be getting tired. Lighter weight costing him????"
"Round 11 belonged to <at>GGG. <at>Canelo came on a kittle late in the round but <at>GGG accumulated punches. If <at>GGG uses his jab, he wins the fight"
"Folks, I know it was close and that <at>Canelo was the constant aggressor. I also predicted <at>Canelo would win by decision. But I had <at>GGGBoxing winning this fight by 1 round"

"Nice stutter-go by Calvin Ridley on WILLIAMS for the <at>Saints secondary. <at>AtlantaFalcons tie it 7-7. <at>Saints secondary still a problem."
"Now, if the <at>AtlantaFalcons can figure out a way to get <at>juliojones_11 the damn ball in the Red Zone, maybe they’d be worthy of being considered contenders again."
"Btw.....I know the <at>Chiefs are up 14-0...but it’s not Patrick MaHomes right now (He’s overthrown on about 3 or 4 occasions). It’s the fact that the <at>49ers are getting completely manhandled by the <at>Chiefs offensive line. Let’s remember this please"
"Whoa! Now THAT was a BIGTIME scramble and strike into the right-end end zone by <at>PatrickMahomes5 . BIGTIME. When I see THAT.....that’s what justifies the praise. Not him having all day to throw to WIDE-OPEN receivers."
"Sack by <at>JJWatt and a strip, although ELI Manning recovered. Watt is looking pretty damn good. Fast &amp; Strong. Impossible to root against the man. But I can’t help but wonder if the <at>Giants horrid offensive line possibly has something to do with him looking so good today."
"Alex Smith to Crowder for a <at>Redskins TD. Second time today safety was late getting over to cover."
"The <at>Saints have a huge problem. Lattimore got scorched in week 1. Today, it’s Williams is getting destroyed. Rookie Calvin Ridley’s got 5 catches for over 130 yards in the first half. Ridley is special, learning from <at>juliojones_11. Fewer excuses for OC Steve Sarkisian"
"OMG. The <at>buffalobills are beating the <at>Vikings 27-0 with a rookie QB — Josh Allen. This...on the same day Alex Smith is ballin for the <at>Redskins. We will definitely have a Kirk Cousins’ discussion on <at>FirstTake tomorrow."
"There may need to be a discussion about <at>AdrianPeterson too. He looks special today. Defying all the odds yet again. How long can this last?"
"I totally understand why the <at>Chiefs have 35pts, especially vs the back-end of this <at>49ers defense. What I want to know is why the HELL does <at>JimmyG_10 — <at>MollyQerim’s Jimmy G — only have 7 pts vs this <at>Chiefs defense? And I didn’t even mention Shanahan!"
"Saw <at>RSherman_25 being helped off the field at end of the half. I hope he’s okay. But the way he was talking to himself. Looking very frustrate, don’t think it’s good."
"The <at>buffalobills are all over <at>KirkCousins8. Sacked 4 times already — all on 3rd downs. <at>Vikings are getting their asses kicked today. Plain &amp; simple"
"The <at>Giants have some dude named Chad Wheeler trying to stop <at>JJWatt 1-on-1. What the hell do they think is gonna happen? 3 sacks......and counting"
"The <at>Saints vs <at>AtlantaFalcons. Almost Never fail to give us a great game. Love it. OT here we come!"

"That roughing the passer call for <at>dak is one of the weakest calls I’ve ever seen in football. Just ridiculous. And <at>Dak jumped up looking for the call too. The <at>Seahawks should’ve ran over and gave him some <at>cottonelle tissue. No wonder he just got intercepted."

"Okay! Okay! I stand corrected.....for the moment. Treat this man Fitzpatrick like the 35-Year-old that he is.#LetsGoPittsburgh"
"Yesssssssss!!!! The Best Receiver in the World — Antonio Brown — scampers in for a Touchdown. <at>Steelers up 16-7.#LetGoDamnit!!!"
"Excellent point just made by <at>JasonWitten on MNF football. Just pointed out how <at>Buccaneers are keeping 2 TE’s on the field to force <at>Steeler to keep their LB’s (Bostic &amp; Williams) out there. Great point!"
"Yeeaahhhhhh! Tip by Bostic on errant throw from Fitzpatrick for <at>steelers 2nd INT of the game. <at>steelers forcing <at>Buccaneers to methodically go down field instead of getting big play and it’s working. Is Fitzpatrick returning to old form? Sure looks like it. #Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
"Great interview by <at>saltersl with the magnificent <at>TonyDungy just now. A wonderful, accomplished reporter talking to an iconic figure so many in the <at>NFL profession owes so much too. Happy that he’s being honored tonight."
"Yeeesssssss! Another int by Fitzpatrick. So many were saying this is the Fitzpatrick we’ve been waiting for. My man <at>keyshawn swore up and town he’d return. Well, he’s arrived. Guess we might see Jameis this season, after all."
"Damn! Damn! Damn! The <at>steelers offense cannot continue to miss these opportunities. This is not going to cut it."
"Aaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!   A Pick-6 by the <at>steelers. Where the hell is the FITZMAGIC tonight??? At this rate, we might see <at>Jaboowins tonight....and he isn’t even eligible to play yet.#LetsGoSteelers. Do not let up"
"Damnit! Damn <at>steelers secondary just gives up a 51-yard bomb to <at>MikeEvans13_ . I can’t get peace with this bunch to save my damn life. Shit"
"<at>kevbarraza <at>steelers <at>MikeEvans13_ Yep. It happens sometime. Stop whining and trying to get someone in trouble. You that damn miserable in your life? Grow up"

"<at>johnvarlas Damn! Damn! Damn! (Haaaa!). That IS what she use to say"
"Yeeeesssssssss!!!!!! Big Ben — the Future Hall Of Famer — Has Shown up tonight in Tampa. A safety vs Ryan Switzer is going to be a mismatch, but the <at>steelers have taken advantage.#YeahYeahYeah!!!!!!"
"I’m sick. Just absolutely sick. Watching this <at>steelers defense, every QB looks like Brady to me against them. Just sitting here agonizing over the likelihood of another TD, which just arrived to <at>MikeEvans13_ . <at>Buccaneers, once down 30-10, are now down 30-27.#S&amp;<at>$"
"Whew!!!! The <at>steelers hold on for 30-27 win. Key stop on final drive for <at>steelers defense plus two huge runs by Connor and a BIGTIME play by Big Ben, scrambling out the pocket to connect with <at>TeamJuJu. They survive. I can sleep in peace now."

"Uh oh! Tuna down and out. Last time we saw Jalen Hurts was in the Nat’l Title game. He was so bad, he got benched and brought in."
"Wow!!!  Jalen Hurts drives <at>AlabamaFTBL right down field to great completions...and throws TD pass on a scramble. 80-yards in 16 plays. BIGTIME performance thus far. Scores tied.#Whoa!!!!!"
"This is UNREAL! What a performance from <at>JalenHurts. To come off the bench and do what he’s done with these last two scoring drives — seen really for the first time in a situation that counts since the title game — is sensational. Special. So happy for him. Shocked, but happy!"
"Huge lesson to all of us out here based on <at>JalenHurts. Lesson in perseverance. In staying on that grind and never giving up. Can’t say enough about this performance. Never saw it coming. <at>FootballUGA should be out. It’s <at>OU_Football or <at>OhioStateFB"
"I gave Fury that first round. Made a wild Wilder miss. Used his jab. Again, Wilder too wild. Needs to calm down and use his jab....set up the right"
"I gave Wilder Round 2 because of a couple of power punches, but still don’t like what I’m seeing. Fury is moving well and using his jab. Wilder’s jab could be sharper. He’s gone away from the body already and is head-hunting"
"I gave round 3 to Fury. Caught Wilder twice, plus is just doing a better job of boxing — hitting, moving while using his jab. Fury up 2 rounds to 1."
"Round 4 to Wilder. But Fury is still making him miss all night with that right. Except this time Fury didn’t connect on anything either. Fury is clearly the better boxer thus far. Just didn’t throw enough punches that round."
"Again, Wilder missing more than connecting. Can buy a right-connect, or a left-hook or haymaker, for that matter. But I still give him the edge because of activity. Fury’s just evading moreso than fighting."
"Fury gets round 6. Here’s the problem: Wilder has got to get on the inside. Fury is comfortable standing outside and pity-patting him to death. And Wilder is throwing no combinations. He hasn’t caught Fury with a power punch in the last 3 rounds. It’s like he’s waiting 4 R-Hand."
"Fury again. He’s winning this fight right now. Wilder relying on big shots, but can’t connect on any of them. He’s getting outboxed, plain and simple. Plus, his left eye is swelling up. Fury is doing precisely what he came on <at>FirstTake and told me he’d do."
"Wilder connected late with a rare power shot but still lost the round. Fury actually looks fresher at this point, too."
"Fury goes down in the 9th. Wilder gets the round 10-8, but if you can believe it Fury gets up and looks fresher than Wilder. Stunned Wilder with left-hook coming in and that paused everything. Wilder looks exhausted."
"Fury wins Round 10. Boxed, moved. Wilder barely threw a punch until the round was over. Wilder has to win 11 &amp; 12th to win this fight"
"Fury again. Just out-Boxing Wilder. Jabs and sharp punches. Wilder answers by punching air. Can’t find Fury. Needs KO to win."
"Ref helped Fury survive in the end. Fight should’ve been stopped in 10 sec. but since it finished, despite the 2-point round, Fury wins by a point — despite getting dropped twice."
"What a great, great call by Nagy for the <at>ChicagoBears to tie the game at the end of regulation. They come back from a 10-point deficit with less than 90 sec left. <at>obj didn’t go after on-side kick and <at>Giants defense didn’t get stops. Just encapsulates their whole season.#Mess"

"Hey <at>ChaseHughesNBCS, just saw your tweet regarding <at>JohnWall. Quote this: I don’t want to hear a damn thing from Wall about talking to him man-to-man. I showed at one game and waited for him in the locker room; he wouldn’t come out. I showed up again when they played <at>celtics"
"And <at>JohnWall still didn’t want to talk, <at>ChaseHughesNBCS. I’ve said nothing to take back and I damn sure don’t hide from anyone. What I said about Wall not being in great shape and struggling periodically was FACT. His appearance at the Rose Bar was courtesy of TMZ, not me!"
"And as for my questioning the timing of <at>JohnWall possibly having surgery, that’s what we feel as fans from witnessing what’s unfolded over this season. Wall knows me. Rich Paul knows me. And there isn’t a soul in sports who doesn’t know how to find me. Any time <at>ChaseHughesNBCS"
"So the next time <at>JohnWall or any player tells you they are looking for me for a man to-man convo, <at>ChaseHughesNBCS, tell them to name the time and place and I’ll show up. I’d welcome it...even on my damn vacation. I’m not the one hiding. Never have! Never will!"

"Wow! What a game. <at>JHarden13 is simply sensational, but <at>clintcapela15 is balling, too. <at>KDTrey5 is balling but missed 2 contested shots late. It’s OT. Harden keeps playing this way and he’ll win MVP again."
"Yo Iguodala, <at>JHarden13 ain’t the guy you try to flop against. Because if you don’t get the call — which you likely won’t — that’s more space for him to drill a 3.....which he did."
"Everyone has mad respect for the <at>warriors. But I don’t see the FEAR that once existed. Without that intimidation factor, things could get really interesting once the playoffs begin"
"The <at>HoustonRockets got hosed on the play. <at>KDTrey5 had both feet out of bounds and in the yellow. Couldn’t be more out of bounds on that save. Refs missed it. <at>StephenCurry30 hits jumper to put <at>warriors up 134-132. Could cost  them game"
"OMG!!! OMG!!!  <at>JHarden13 pulls up for big-time 3 on both <at>KlayThompson &amp; <at>Money23Green with 1-Second left in OT. He has 44pts, ladies &amp; gentleman. The Best scorer in the game, the reigning MVP, just won the game......putting on a show. This brother is unreal, and special."

"I can’t believe what the hell im seeing. I never, in my wildest dreams, believed I’d see <at>AlabamaFTBL defense look like this, not TUA throwing 2 INT’s. What the hell is going on here, <at>finebaum? What is going on?"
"Jesus! <at>Alabama looks as if they’re about to get blown out. <at>ClemsonFB  is all over them!"

"And how many times are the <at>Chargers gonna find themselves in 3rd-and-long situations? I mean, do something on the first 2 downs of a drive."
"The <at>Patriots are hitting Ohillip Rivers at every turn. Flowers is bulldozing through <at>Chargers off. Line. Plus, Rivers arm doesn’t appear strong enough to make accurate throws outside the numbers down field. It’s just all falling apart before our very eues"
"Rough day for King. Getting burned in coverage. Getting penalized. And now fumbling a punt return. <at>Patriots about to close these boys out, barring a miracle. What a disgraceful performance by the <at>Chargers."
"The GREAT Jim Nance just brought up the <at>Chargers traveling back from Baltimore, then back to New England. But I agree with Romo: the <at>Patriots are just physically abusing these boys. Should’ve stuck to my guns: Cali team too soft for cold weather come playoff time.#GameOver"
"Who’s the <at>Chargers defensive coordinator? Gus Bradley? Boy does he have some explaining to do. Then again, the <at>Patriots have 5 TD’s. The <at>Chargers have 5 first downs. That’s just pure domination = Belichick over 2-year coach Anthony Lynn."
"Btw.....this is really not on Phillip Rivers. He’s not getting ANY protection. Off. Line are missing blocked left and right. The <at>Chargers are looking like we suspected. Looks like a lot of us got hoodwinked. A miracle now qualifies as the game simply being competitive.#Damn"

"<at>Andy_destroyer1 What I questioned was A.) How you looked physically (all due respect.....as has everyone else) and the fact that a megafight was ruined because Anthony Joshua got his butt whipped by you. A Megafight isn’t just about the fighters themselves, but who people are actually salivating"
"<at>Andy_destroyer1 .....to see. Fair or unfair, the public was clamoring for Wilder vs. Joshua. That is not a knock against you. You’ve proven your worth and your time has arrived.

"That was just a damn-good TD pass from Foles. The <at>Jaguars didn’t see that in years with Blake Bortles as their  QB. This is what they paid Foles for. We’ll see if it continues."
"OMG. Lamar Jackson just connected with Brown on an 83-yard bomb for a TD. Perfect throw from Lamar. And this kid, Brown: a rookie. First 2 catches of NFL career=Both TD. Young brother is putting on a show. Horrible start for <at>MiamiDolphins, down 21-0 to <at>Ravens."
"MaHomes to Watkins on a drag route = 49-yard TD connection. Too many plays thus far where <at>chiefs receivers are wide open. Not the Jacksonville defense I expected. Oh, Btw, Nick Foles our for rest of game w/ shoulder injury on that TD throw. Damn!"
"Peeps, maybe it’s just that the <at>MiamiDolphins defense is just this bad. But y’all need to know: <at>Lj_era8 is putting on a damn show for the <at>Ravens. His throws are right on target. He’s flinging this football all over the field. If he runs &amp; throws, God help rest of the NFL."
"Nice move by my man <at>tkelce for a 41-yard hookup from <at>PatrickMahomes. Again, Jags far less impressive than I expected. I know the <at>Chiefs offense is a juggernaut, but still. Btw.....MaHomes is now being helped off field. He’s limping"
"Also, one big surprise, another not so big: A.) <at>Redskins are kicking the <at>Eagles butt right in Philadelphia, 17-0. B.) No surprise at all that the Rams are all over Cam Newton. They’re only up 10-0, but Csm has been over-throwing or under-throwing in the 1st Half=No Surprise!"
"Just a disgraceful performance by the <at>MiamiDolphins. They’re down 42-3 BEFORE the half — at HOME — but that’s not the only reason. They are dropping passes left &amp; right. Missing tackles, etc. Flores has his work cut out for him. Just a horrible performance."
"Okay <at>K1, I see you. I see you. 18 pets in the 4th QT for the <at>AZCardinals. Scored tied at 24 with seconds left. OT is about to arrive."

"In <at>UMichFootball’s opening drive, we saw a WR devoid of breakaway speed, a QB that couldn’t connect on a slant pattern over the middle for a TD, and a RB (Mason) who committed their 9th fumble of the season (6 lost). And we’re wondering why Harbaugh won’t win w/ these guys?"
"Damn great catch by <at>UMichFootball Ronnie Bell. Big time catch.....completely extended on that 22-yard catch. The kid can play. Ball can touch ground so long as it’s completely secure so it should be ruled a catch. But again, the kid’s got skills."
"Just ruled a non-catch by <at>UMichFootball’s Bell. Bogus. Should’ve been a catch. This kid is the only thing I like about the Wolverines’ Offense right now."
"Good Lord. The first QT hasn’t even ended yet and <at>BadgerFootball’s Jonathan Taylor already has 2 TD’s and 143-yards rushing after just scampering for a 72-yard TD run. The way <at>UMichFootball Offense is looking, this game is already over. Can’t see them coming back."
"I’m done watching this <at>BadgerFootball vs <at>UMichFootball game. UM is getting DESTROYED. Beat like they stole something. This is embarrassing. So much for Harbaugh’s team having a chance this game. Just a joke. I’m done!"
"The <at>UMichFootball had 2 Damn Weeks to prepare for this game. Can’t stop the run. Can’t pressure. No discipline. And that’s just the defense. The offense is so much worse. They should be ashamed of the way they look. They can’t run. Can’t protect the QB. Just horrible.#Damn!"

"No matter how Good Will Harris has been for the <at>astros in the postseason, you must go to Gerrit Cole — your damn Ace. You saw the <at>Nationals go to Corbin, right? That’s what you do. Hinch overthought a lot in Game 7. And it cost the <at>astros a title."

"It’s official. The <at>NCAA is a damn travesty. This kid Wiseman is ineligible — after already starting the season — because COACH Penny Hardaway is a booster? This is straight B.S. no wonder <at>KingJames and so many others are so against the NCAA. Hey <at>NBA, I’ve got an idea:"
"Go ahead afterall and add a 3rd round in the <at>NBA draft. Just make sure to create a route where kids can finish their education, plus have an insurance policy for potential injuries. Enough with the <at>NCAA. They just need to go. They make me so sick. Why’d the kid start the season"

"What in the Hell is going on with <at>AlabamaFTBL right now??? First, a fumble by Tua, messing up a TD. Then a muffed punt. Now an INT called back because of 12-men on the field. Who is this team right now????#Damn!!!!"
"This is the 3rd blitz we’ve seen from <at>LSUfootball where the defender was not even TOUCHED by <at>AlabamaFTBL’s offensive line.....having clear shots at Tua. This is not looking good, Damnit!!!"
"I’m done. I’m giving it up to <at>mspears96, <at>Realrclark25 and <at>ESPNBooger. What I’m seeing from <at>LSUfootball is an ass whupping in <at>AlabamaFTBL. Bama can’t stop them and, offensively, Tua &amp; the boys ain’t doing anything. Too many mistakes, too. Just awful, just like Nat’l title GM."
"Add dropped touchdown passes to the lost of <at>AlabamaFTBL mistakes. That was a perfect throw to Jeudy and he flat-out dropped it.#IAmDepressed!"
"The <at>LSUfootball Tigers went into Tuscaloosa and dropped 40!!! I can’t say a damn word. Because I did not see this coming!"
"About damn time Jeudy. That was the 2nd TD pass you dropped, fore making up for it by catching that one. NOW <at>AlabamaFTBL..whatcha gonna do. Can you get 1-damn-stop and get Tua the ball back with enough time left? Can you do it? It’s time, damnit!"
"I don’t even know who this <at>AlabamaFTBL team is. Could not get a single stop that mattered all game long. <at>LSUfootball rolled into TUSCALOOSA and nearly dropped 50 on the Tide. Embarrassing performance by Bama’s D! Props to the Tigers. Can’t say a word!"

"Go to <at>MylesLGarrett page and you’ll see the headline: “A Hero is made by the path he chooses, not by the power he is graced with.” Yet, he goes and does what he did to Mason Rudolph. This calls for an automatic SEASON-ENDING SUSPENSION. He should be DONE for the rest of the year"
"And btw....neither Pouncey nor DiCastro should be suspended AT ALL. All they did was protect a defenseless teammate — who happened to be their damn QUARTERBACK. They shouldn’t be penalized at all."

"<at>E_Reid35 Yet attack brothers — Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z, ME — at every turn the second someone disagrees with you. You <at>E_Reid35 got the nerve to call out the <at>NFL when your beef was suppose to be with society in regards to police brutality and racial oppression. Where’s your plan?"
"<at>E_Reid35 Huh <at>E_Reid35? To call our or beat up everyone who utters a word you disagree with? All Brithers, BTW. Let me tell you something Mr. <at>E_Reid35: Kaepernick has been supported. We’ve all said he was done wrong. That he was blackballed. That he should be in the league. Who the hell"
"<at>E_Reid35 Hasn’t acknowledged that? But life isn’t fair. It damn sure ain’t ideal. And at some point, you’ve got the grab the opportunity. Kap’s occurred today. And what does he do: alters the process, and shows up with a T-Shirt alluding to SLAVERY <at>E_Reid35. For a JOB INTERVIEW! When"
"<at>E_Reid35 are you — yes, you <at>E_Reid35 — going to wake the hell up and realize that maybe, just maybe, the enemy at THIS POINT ain’t the NFL. It’s not Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z or ME. Maybe the enemy is YOU, your childish tendencies and your unwillingness to accept that you can’t run......."
"<at>E_Reid35 a damn thing but so much when your hand is out for someone else’s dime or product. Especially when you haven’t played in 3 years, when you were 1-10 in your last 11 games as a starter and the top-4 league MVP candidates are all black <at>E_Reid35. When will you learn?"
"<at>E_Reid35 Chances are.....you won’t. Because your ears are clogged and you’re too blinded by vitriol to see when a brother is showing you — y’all — love and respect <at>E_Reid35 by simply letting you know what will work at what won’t. But oh, I forgot: we all ain’t S&amp;<at>$ in your world. So..."
"<at>E_Reid35 why even bother. You’ll never listen. But others will hear <at>E_Reid35. You can bet the house on that. Just listen. It’s coming from the multitude of places. And it’s damn sure — like a storm — on <at>FirstTake Monday morning. So buckle the hell up!
