"I'm done with the Lakers. Finished!!! I know they'll beat Houston on Sunday, but that is not the point. This team is unreliable. Totally!"
"How can anyone possibly see the Lakers beating Cleveland at this point? Hell, they may not make it to the Finals. Denver may beat them."
"At the end of the day, Kobe has NO HELP when it counts most. His boys fold like cheap tents. That means Odom, Bynum, Gasol. Everybody."
"And speaking of Speaker Pelosi, here's my question: If you have any skeletons at all, how STUPID can you be to go after the C.I.A.???"

"<at>BogWetsel Don't agree with that at all, Bob. Van Gundy is a damn good coach. He just needs to calm down sometimes, that's all."
"<at>m1ntyi LeBron and Kobe works for me. I believe the way Denver looks, Melo and LeBron will have their time. This is the time for Kobe/LeBron"

"Remember, anyone looking to interact with me tonight can catch me after the game on vitaminwater's fan page. But I'll tweet DURING the game"
"So far this game epitomizes why there's the Great Debate about Kobe/LeBron. The Lakers, so far, won't do much to separate themsemves. Kobe.."
"Did anyone see how Kobe just looked at Vujajic after he missed that wide-open jumper to end the 1st? Ha! That's what I'm saying."
"A put back by Melo, then by Martin. Notice the trend? Where the hell are the Lakers' Frontline. Gasol? Odom? Ariza?"
"I smell <url>ing. Don't know why. I just do"
"Good play, but wrong man. Fisher's lost so much confidence. Now LA is in deep trouble. In their mind, they should be up 2-0. TROUBLE!!!"
"The game is over, join me on <url>/vitaminwater to discuss. Direct link to the discussion: <url>"
"LeBron's a manchild. If he ever develops a consistent perimeter game, he will go down as THE GREATEST OFFENSIVE PLAYER IN NBA HISTORY."
"Reminder everybody! Get involved in vitamin water's Great Debate: LeBron vs. Kobe. You've seen them both. Especially in these playoffs."
"No wonder there's a great debate. It is absolutely shocking to me LeBron has to do everything, just like Kobe"
"Oooooohhhhhh Mmmmyyyyy God!"
"LeBron did. Saved the series, Period.
I'll be talking to everyone on <url>/vitaminwater in a few hours. There's a lot to talk about"
"We Are All Witnesses!!,"
"1 more thing: LeBron was covered on that last shot, but he found a way to TAKE that last shot. Kobe should've done the same. Not Fisher"
"Btw...my sister Arlyne, who knows nothing about Basketball, is calling to tell me there's no way LeBron is better than Kobe. Hard to argue"
"Kenyon Martin giving guarantees, then going out and scoring 6 pts before fouling out. He might want to Shut up now"
"Kobe hit 15 of 17 FT's. Big three as the game waned. That's what makes choosing b/t him and LeBron so hard. Kobe's still the ultimate closer"
"The real problem is Mo Williams.. It's bad enough he's undersized, but he's not making shots. LeBron has minimal help right now. It's Bad."
"BTW everybody.......I approve of Obama's choice, Sonia Sotomayor... For the Supreme Court. It's the right pick. I hope he gets 2 more picks"
"Btw...and for those on the Right who consider Sotomayor a radical pick. Now they know how the Left felt about Clarence Thomas"
"Btw.....LeBron has got to stop jacking up these three's. It's not helping. Actually, someone should attack Dwight Howard. Get him agitated."
"WOW!!!!! LeBron makes the 2 FT's with 0.5 left. Tell the truth? How many of you thought he'd make both? I damn-sure had my questions."
"<at>KevMiz You're right. Might've happened."
"It's OVER!!!!!! The Orlando Magic are going to the NBA Finals. The Magic -- and Dwight Howard -- will close this out in Game 6"
"I'm on vitainwater's Facebook page right now. To debate Kobe vs. Lebron with me go here <url>"
"One thing I know for sure. If anyone wants to see LeBron and the Cavs called out, just watch Skip Bayless on 1st Take. He won't Disappoint."
"Nene should not have fouled out on that play. That should've been called on Gasol"
"Great pass by Kobe to Odom for the 3-pt play, passing up the wide-open 3. But what a damn shame that Gasol can't back down KM on the block"
"<at>six_nine_sports Tell you're wife to make sure she has a thing for HER HUSBAND. I'm tired of good fellas not getting enough love :)"
"Ya know something: I'm watching Pres. Obama in California for his fundraising efforts, knowing how much their economy is suffering. And...."
"<url>e up with an idea for Gov. Schwarzenegger: How about raising taxes on the Entertainment Industry. Evidently, they have the $$$"
"It's amazing how easy it looks for Orlando to score w/o LeBron in the game. But.....Mo Williams is hitting shots. So it might not matter"
"Unbelievable! Cleveland opens up the half trying to throw the ball into Big Z...knowing he can't handle Howard. The Cavs are tight. It's all"
"LeBron needs to stop with all those pull-up jumpers. Mo Williams is hot. Get him the ball. Plus, by doing so LeBron can conserve energy."
"<at>"
"And ya know..I've been asked if Denver was the last team the NBA wanted in the Finals -- due to all their tattoos, etc., and the image issue"
"I actually may have given a touch of credibility to it if the game were close. But watching Kobe perform says it all. Statement game, folks!"
"<at>m1ntyi All Denver needs is another big man and an image makeover. They don't need everyone thinking they're a bunch of thugs."

"Hey folks, I'm hanging in West Covina (Ca.) Watching my little nephew, Nicholas Brown, play little league baseball. He's good. Much, much..."

"<at>doubleGmik Black people -- Listen. Brothers with a bunch of tatoos are a turnoff for White America. A gangsta look makes leagues nervous."

"Hey, don't miss checking out the new Dwight Howard vitaminwater ad. I've seen it. I'm in it -- just one sentence. It's HYSTERICAL. Seriously"
"Judging by his built, alone, we all knew Dwight gets his vitamins. But he's hilarious, ya'll. His Stan Van Gundy imitations are priceless."
"And by the way, i'll be tweeting tonight during the game. I'm still involved with vitaminwater's Great Debate. No matter. Lakers in 6."
"Haaa!!!! I have no idea, Dawg. How ya doing, Big Fella?  -- Stephen A!"
"just <at>reply <at>stephenasmith on twitter and I'll respond to your questions."
"Do ya'll see the look in Kobe's eyes??? We all need to watch this.....this sense of urgency you just don't teach. This is why he's so great"
"Game 1 is over. Look at Van Gundy's face when Kobe scored. He's demoralized already. Even JACK is giving Kobe a bow!!!"
"People, whatever you do....avoid courts at all cost. I'm in court fighting a speeding ticket. Didn't hire a lawyer. Still waiting....2 hours"

"<at>Kuhlmad Pray a lot. And even then, I don't think the Cavs are keeping LeBron in Cleveland."
"After the game, join me on USTREAM to discuss Game 2. <url>"
"WOW!!!!!!!!!"
"Kobe fault: Time is winding down and Lamar Odom is WIDE OPEN in left-corner. He should've fed Odom instead of taking the contested shot"
"Great pass by Bryant; great finish by Gasol. But what I'm loving most is Gasol and especially Odom's perimeter defense on Lewis. That's key"
"i'm live on USTREAM answering questions! Join me! <url>"
"Also....don't know how interested folks are in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, but Mortimer Zuckerman makes a strong case for Israel."
"<at>joserchaps9 No! They're not done. Not until Game 4. They'll win Game 3. Game 4 will decide if this is a series."
"<at>Solefob Not true if Hamas is the real power in Palestine and they're not satisfied with anything but Israel's obliteration."
"<at>therealbenh Why on earth do you think me -- of all people -- would make a good diplomat. Don't believe I have a diplomatic bone in my body"
"<at>mistajayyy I agree with Zuckerman's point. But I know that isn't all there is to it. But it's difficult to side with suicide bombers. Sorry"

"5:05 pm. Still stuck on the runway. May not make the game in time. In 1st class, and still no food is being served. Damn Shame!!!!!!!"
"I just finished standing talking to all of my boys at ESPN.. Nobody's confident in what they're seeing right now, not even MAGIC!!!!"
"But damn!!!! Same for Hedo.
Then a big-time block by D-Howard......then another short-J from Hedo. Orlando is going to have to pay him"
"Love D-Howard. But he's really messin up with these free throws."
"Another big-time 3 by Fisher. Wow! Then I think he was staring at my man, Mark Jackson.. 31.3 second left. This is the series, ya'll"

"Come join me on USTREAM! I'm answering questions live! <url>"
"See, here's the thing: Champions respond defensively no matter how they're struggling offensively. The Magic look lost when they can't score"
"Before any of you bring it up...YES!!! I noticed Kobe jumping up in the air and pumping his fist just like JORDAN did in 1998"
"OMG.......Dr. Buss' son was a TERRIBLE interview. Who the hell thought to have him speak for the team???"

"This is my last day of this 2-week stint on 1st Tebow -- I mean 1st Take. And there's no way I'm departing quietly. I don't give a frogs fat"
"You know what about SKIP BASELESS being in Denver to do the show with all those Tebow lovers. I don't care if he's backed by an army."
"Enough of this already. Let's get it on. All you Tebow lovers. Bring it! 1st Take in the house on ESPN2. I'll Show up. Will ya'll????"
"Gotta say, sitting here watching the Knicks vs Nets, I'm liking what I see from rookies Schumpert and Harrelson. ... <url>"

"We'll get into it all. Knicks, Nets, Jets, Giants, Tebowmania, etc. Feel free to tweet right here or call in at 800.919.3776. Holla!"
"I picked the Eagles to win today, but this is just a damn DISGRACEFUL performance by the Jets. So ill-prepared. Don't deserve playoffs."
"And the Giants are even worse. If Tom Coughlin loses his job after this season, look no further than their loss today as a huge reason why!"
"Btw.......it's not an accident that I didn't mention Tim Tebow. Let's just say, win, lose or draw, I'm happy I'm not on 1st Take until Wed."
"Can't take another minute of Skip BAYLESS' mouth. Just can't do it. Need a break!"
"I repeat: I will NOT be on 1st Take Monday or Tuesday. Not on the show again until Wednesday. Hopefully, Tebow will lose today."
"Thanks, <at>KoreyWitaK. Really appreciate the retweet."
"UNLEASH!!! All he does is win games..all....all he does is win games."" -- NOT!!! I DON'T THINK SO. Now can we get back to talking FOOTBALL??"
"And btw.......let's give Tom Brady the credit he deserves. He's truly BIGTIME! Worthy of BRADY-MANIA! But we won't go there. Unnecessary!"
"<at>FerRuiz90 oh! But Skip's love affair with Tebow makes him a paragon of professionalism, huh? You Tebow lovers are something else."
"Oh no,<at>Dru512. Don't whine and moan now. I've had to listen to ya'll gloating for weeks. Take this and shut your mouth. Deal with it."
"Let us pray, <at>NewPort_Hendrix"
"Actually, I'm glad I'm not on, <at>sKatENastY_Jay. I'm going to enjoy watching Skip trying to explain all of this, because we know he will try"

"Fyi...I'll be back on 1st Take on ESPN2 tomorrow morning to go up against my man Skip Bayless. I sincerely hope he's off Tebow. We pray:-)"
"Anything's possible<at>RyanSParker. But please understand: If D-Howard swears he's not re-signing with someone, then no one will trade for him"

"FYI: I won't have a damn thing to say about Tebow until Wednesday. I've saving all my material until then. See you soon <at>RealSkipBayless"
"Merry Christmas everybody! I'm here at the Knicks' Game and I'm loving 2 things: Their defensive intensity and rookie Iman Shumpert."
"Right back at ya!!!"
"This is what you have to be concerned about in D'Antoni's system. Shumpert looking for own shot a bit too much. Everyone has green light."
"Who's the man in New York City. Take a look at who's NOT:......<url>"

"I'm getting very disgusted damnit! The Knicks played good D for one quarter, now look at them. And this is w/o Boston having Pierce. Damnit!"
"Mind you, we haven't even gotten to the offense. Amar'e dribbling. Horrid passing! No structure whatsoever. A 21-2 run by SUBS. Damn!"

"<at>MrSelfMadeMan Never said that."

"<at>Cnote4evrJordan Why in the hell would I tell you that? Don't ever ask me such a damn question again."
"<at>nyk7melo Not true. I just don't kiss their underwear like you do."
"There was no excuse for that elbow by MWP on Harden, <at>johnnythefreaky. Definitely warranted an ejection. Suspension is <url>ing."
"Gotta tell y'all, I'm here at this Lakers/OKC Game and I've never seen Westbrook look this bad or Durant disappear like this. Very bad!"

"<at>MrEricVega Thanks!"
"<at>NJDEV89 Haaaaa! You wish!"
"<at>brothatrain That's precisely what I've said!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a ROMP! The Knicks are getting owned. LBJ is killin! Refs aren't helping. But it's only the 1st Half."
"To be fair to the Knicks, though, Chandler is sick as a dog and playing like it with 7 TO's in the half. But still 32.4 percent FG. Damn!!!"
"Let's not get it twisted though. Regardless of how sick Chandler is, this is embarrassing. No effort whatsoever. At least not yet. BAD!!!"
"Mind you, this annihilation is taking place with the players knowing Woodson's future's on the line and could depend on these playoffs."
"OMG No!!!!!!!! Iman Shumpert just went down. Grabbing his left knee. He can't walk. They have to carry him off. Series just ended. Damn!"
"There will be plenty of moments where we may have reasons to question LeBron during these playoffs. This isn't one of them. Phenonmenal."
"Melo! That's another matter entirely.  Especially after this performance. Amar'e too!"

"Btw......stay tuned for me and <at>RealSkipBayless to go at it during the Mayweather/Cotto fight!"
"Oh Gawd! Am I really suppose to feel flattered that <at>RealSkipBayless mention me and Tiago Splitter in same breath?"
"I don't care that Sugar Shane is still standing/throwing. He's taking too much punishment. This could end badly!"
"<at>RealSkipBayless did ya see Floyd just sending the pace. Moving side-to-side. Hitting with the job. We already see  the superior boxer. FMJ"
"<at>RealSkipBayless no way. Floyd won 1st Rd 10-9."
"<at>RealSkipBayless I'd give that Round 2 to Cotto. Connected with a flurry earlier on, even though FMJ started eating him up late."
"3rd Round went to Floyd, <at>RealSkipBayless. All of Cotto's blows were blocked. Floyd rolled with all of them."
"Now do you not see who's landing the harder, cleaner shots, <at>RealSkipBayless. Cotto caught him with a few shots. But not enough."
"10-9 Floyd!"
"Round 5: Mayweather. Cotto's leaning, but Floyd is rolling punched them catching Cotto.  10-9 Floyd."
"Round 6: Cotto bloodies Floyd's nose. Catched Floyd with a couple of solid shots to the body as well. Could be getting interesting!"
"Cotto 10-9 <at>RealSkipBayless."
"It's getting closer <at>RealSkipBayless. Cotto's defense is impressive. So is his job. Cotto 10-9 in Round 7."
"<at>RealSkipBayless, I don't know what the hell Mayweather is doing early in Round 8. Doesn't make sense to me."
"Round 8: Definitely went to Mayweather, <at>RealSkipBayless. This is now a TIED fight. What the hell!"
"Round 9 goes to Mayweather, <at>RealSkipBayless. He connected more, fended Cotto off. But Cotto does look supremely confident. We'll see."
"Round 10 went to Mayweather, <at>RealSkipBayless. Cotto took rounds 9 and 10 off."
"<at>RealSkipBayless Stop it. Mayweather's picked up the pace and it's Cotto who's run out of gas. Though, If Cotto wins Round 12, up 4 grabs!"
"<at>RealSkipBayless Mayweather closed baby! Floyd handled his business. I got Floyd winning the fight 116-113. Cotto lost last 3 Rounds."
"I'm about to be on Sportscenter now, then again after 12 Noon, then again at 2pm."
"Knicks win the series? Oh, that's hysterical <url>"
"<at>GabeNickel9 Sorry! No chance of that happening!"

"<at>dallas3163 Spare me. The joke is on people like you who try to pair one with the other. His faith should not infiltrate the game. Period!"
"After I do Sportscenter at 9:25, gotta get ready for 1st Take w/ <at>RealSkipBayless. Clips/NFL/T.O./Tiago/Lakers/Knicks. Stay tuned!"
"To all my fans -- and Haters -- here's to you: <url> . Enjoy!"
"Osi Umenyiora weighs in on Amani Toomer and concussions. So I'm weighing in on him: <url>"
"Kobe! Special! Lawd have mercy!"
"<at>REAL_RONMEXICO you're insane"
"<at>Lunch44 The ultimate hedger. He's something else :-)"

"<at>MrCrisp_ Every Single Damn Day :-)"
"<at>ItsDezzWhite Call me when you're in your mid-40's bro. My lady <url>plaining. Fall back."
"Still on the radio with my man <at>RyanRuocco right here on the all New ESPN NY (98.7FM) everyday weekday from 1-3pm. Call 800.919.3776 anytime"
"<at>dfreefunza Thank you!"
"<at>_LaMalinche thanks bro!"
"<at>JaviH77 yep"
"Yes. I am live from S. Beach. I will be debating <at>RealSkipBayless on Amar'e, Melo, LeBron, Flacco/Romo and whatever else he annoys me about."
"Make sure to lock in right here on ESPN2. FIRST <url>ing at you. Buckle up!"
"<at>carmeloanthony <at>nyknicks Damn, I hope you're right."
"<at>MrEdLover I hear ya, big boy."
"<at>ThaBlackGuy008 Shut the hell up, please. I didn't hear initially, and I'm fully aware of Omaha Beach. Mind your damn business and watch."
"<at>Weeb_BabyReed <at>jemelehill <at>RealSkipBayless You can debate us anytime you want, bro. Just put in the 20-plus years we had to, and it's cool."
"Hope y'all are checking <at>RealSkipBayless and I out on 1st Take right now."
"<at>MzRedBottoms red bottoms???"
"<at>deee1_ Love it, but go study for those Finals, my man! Pass those classes"
"I totally agree with <at>RealSkipBayless on Beckett. Dude has 3 seasons with .sub 5.00 ERA in last 5 years. Collecting the check!"
"As for the Lakers tonight, Kobe was exactly right to call out Bynum and Gasol. And if Bynum doesn't show up and they lose, he may be gone!"
"However, I don't agree with Magic Johnson that Mike Brown will be gone if they lose. Jim Buss is too cheap right now to make that move."
"<at>2NONE21 Absolutely not. I give props for what he's <url>plished but I may sure to remind him there's a bigger goal."
"Incredible, Incredible MVP-Acceptance speech by LeBron James. As if we didn't have enough reasons to root for him b4, add 1 more to the list"
"<at>sidrosenberg Don't twist my words, Sid. I didn't root for him vs. the Knicks. Plus, I just don't wish on him what will happen if he loses."
"<at>WestGaFresh Agreed"
"<at>jordannumber5 if they're serious about winning a title , they should blow it up. Or at least trade Josh Smith, who wants out anyway."
"Stephen A on the NBA. That's what we're gonna call 1st Take today with <at>RealSkipBayless. Somebody has to school him. Buckle up!!!"
"One of these days <at>RealSkipBayless will learn to listen to me. I told him what OKC would do in Game 1. Someday he'll learn people! Someday!"
"I give up. Metta World Peace says ""We Did Okay"" after losing my 30. Then he repeated ""We Did Okay."" I just don't know what to say anymore:-)"
"<at>patfan79 Puh- leeze"
"FYI.....from this day forward ANYONE using the ""N"" word or any offensive language on my page will be blocked. You've been warned."
"We took a day off for a Bigger purpose, <at>216Tone. Relax. It's one day. We're back tomorrow."
"I can't wait to get back on 1st Take tomorrow with <at>RealSkipBayless. I already know what he's going to say. Doesn't matter. I'll deal w/ him"
"Haaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I'm LIVE on ESPN New York (98.7FM) right now. Talking Heat/Knicks/Jets/Mets/Yankees. Tune in. Call 800.919.3776. But not if ur scared!!"
"<at>atleastdoe not true. You're blind!"
"<at>dfreefunza STHU!!!!! Know what you're talking about. I did say the Pacers deserved it."
"<at>Yung_Lion21 I agreed with that!"
"<at>ReeknHavoc I'm only critical of him in the last 2 min. Aside from that, he's the best in the world!"
"<at>kmelvin32 LeBron is mentally soft/weak in the last 2 minutes; best in the world in first 46. You have a problem w/ that, u don't like facts"
"<at>Baber4 Thank You!"
"<at>JJQui That's not what was REPORTED. Also, they went to his website and say he refused to refute such words."
"<at>dfreefunza Yes Sir!"
"Buckle up and get ready. <at>RealSkipBayless is tripping right now on Kobe, LeBron. 1st <url>ing at ya right now"
"<at>LawrenceMarbury Thank you, sir."
"<at>HDBleu_Blase Just did :-)"
"<at>RckyB ESPN New York (98.7FM) in New York. Go to <url>"
"I told ya'll what would happen to the Heat tonight. Now I'm telling ya'll they will amp it up another level and win Game 4. D-Wade explodes!"
"<at>ThatManCam Stop Whining!"
"<at>bigrobdIII I have and I will. Have no choice."
"I'm not going to lie: I need to keep my cool right now. I'm very, very scared of what I'm going to say about the Heat on 1st Take tomorrow."
"<at>TheCoryRadest Because the truth hurts!"
"1st Take hasn't even started yet and already <at>RealSkipBayless is trippin! On D-Wade. On LeBron. On Kobe. No worries, though. I'm here!"
"I win yet another bet vs <at>RealSkipBayless . Told him LA would win this game, even if I gave him the Pts. I live to educate this man :-)"
"I know I said this Spurs/Clips series is over -- and that they'd be lucky to win again, but a 24-0 run? 13-straight miss shots? Embarrassing"
"<at>Ardit59 Yes! Just have to raise up and make sure the Pacers know they will NOT be punked! Enough of this."
"Win, lose or draw, I've got to admit: <at>RealSkipBayless is right to some degree about Westbrook. 5 damn possessions. Not a peak at Durant!"
"Let me say this about the Westbrook Turnover: I'm here. The changing of the floors makes things moist. He's slipped several times."
"Gasol? Absolutely, positively no excuse! Had a wide-open shot. Shouldn't have passed it. It's over now!!!"
"Saturday Night Live spoofed me last night. And I got to admit: it was damn HILARIOUS! Loved it! Hysterical!!!"
"<at>gatormann52 Always give colleagues credit. If someone is good enough to work with, they're good enough to respect"
"<at>BGene5187 Thank You"
"<at>Stephen57YOLO actually, I don't sing. I just listen"
"<at>mmayo17 who gives a damn!"
"SAS - Today is TebowFreeTV. Skip won the Webby, now he can’t talk Tebow. Let’s see how long he can hold out. <url>  "
"LeBron and D-Wade explodes. Metta World Peace chimes in. And <at>RealSkipBayless has a problem with it. Surprise! Surprise! 1st Take <url>ing!"
"Right Now!!!!!!!"
"Playing Host today, folks. Me and <at>RealSkipBayless. Talking Miami, NFL, Iverson, and more. Buckle up. We're on right now!!!!"
"I see everyone is talking about my spoof. Hilarious!!!!"
"Yes, he is making me do this. But I'm loving it :-)"
"Gotta give credit where it's due: <at>RealSkipBayless was absolutely correct. Wade was sensational and Miami closed. I'm <url>plaining :-)"
"<at>MrBpiffin I look good, bro. I'm good. And I don't give a damn about how another man thinks I look. I don't flow that way."
"<at>fkjrpanther13 Thank you, bro."
"<at>DSM_Kurt <at>ColemanESPN <at>TheCoachESPN Whhoooooaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!"
"Hope ya'll enjoyed the beatdown I delivered to <at>RealSkipBayless this morning. Don't forget: Another <url>ing on Memorial Day Monday."
"<at>phillymademe Stop it!"
"I am sitting her watching the Rangers/Devils Hockey Game. Tied 2-2 with 14:50 left. What the Hell is this <url>ing to <at>RyanRuocco :-)"
"Won't happen :-)"
"<at>dclazshow I'm trying to figure out who told you I give a damn about whether you like me or not :-)"
"<at>MrWare21 We're professionals!"
"<at>jozzroman9220 I won't be mad. I respect the job the Sixers have done this year. Mad respect."
"<at>JUXinGToN Whatever you say!"
"Knicks! Woodso! Now What?  <url>  "
"Knicks! Woodson! Now what? <url>  "
"<at>MightyJChrist"
"Sometimes, everybody's an expert, <at>MightyJChrist. A Dead Clock is right twice a day!"
"Gotta admit, I don't like what I'm seeing from the Celtics right now. It's early, but they're already looking sluggish and sporadic."
"However, I did say that Brandon Bass and Pietras would be key and it's sure looking that way!"
"W/ 4:16 left Paul Pierce just fouled out. Things could get very interesting."
"Correction: Rondo."
"Yes they are, <at>RealSkipBayless. We've waited long enough!"
"Right back at you, <at>RealTracyMorgan. Keep doing what you do."
"JESUS! Tiago Splitter is just pathetic at the FT line. HORRIBLE!!!"
"Tiago makes my boy Shaq looj like Ray Allen or Reggie Miller. Damn!"
"Fyi......1st Take is being moved to ESPNews at 10 due to the Tennis match on ESPN2. The minute the man is over, we'll be back on the deuce."
"Hope y'all enjoyed 1st Take today. About <url>e on Sportscenter RIGHT NOW!!!"
"Happy Birthday to you son bro, <at>DwyaneWade. All the best to you and your family!"
"<at>Tony_Tooon I say 4 Games."
"<at>futureRT_tobi I'm starting to think that way."
"I'm about <url>e on Sportscenter right now. Talking Heat/Celtics. Warming up for <at>RealSkipBayless on FIRST TAKE tomorrow morning!"
"<at>ECandelari05 Only because of injury. Nothing else!"
"<at>HuntPiece27 Ummmm, but I do. Listen, learn and deal with it."
"It's a 2-hour show, <at>HarlemNash. What's sad is your lack of appreciation for our willingness to be honest and delve into issues."
"Thank you, <at>NBsAceBoogy <at>stephenasmith"
"Reach out to me again, <at>TheBnchwarmer when you know what the hell you're talking about."
"My segment wasn't even about the game, <at>Eroc77. It was about a side issue that's been going on with officiating. Grow up. Listen!"
"Can't wait for 1st Take tomorrow. Anxious to see what <at>RealSkipBayless has to say about LeBron, the Celts, the officials. Check y'all in AM."
"1st <url>ing at you right now!!!"
"<at>DVNine2xo I'd win for you, too :-)"
"<at>stlkbigdavid You're <url>e."
"<at>iBreatheUF Keep listening. Keep learning."
"<at>TGlas05 thank you."
"<at>Austieepowell <at>paulwodarczyk Let him know."
"<at>louielou7 Thank God you said that."
"<at>amendoza99b <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>RealSkipBayless Not even close. LeBron is a league MVP. Tebow's a BACKUP QUARTERBACK."
"<at>louielou7 Say what you want about him, but there's no arguing that."
"<at>DatBoiBlackice <at>Supaman404 Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa."
"<at>MackDian Always."
"<at>DribblePasShoot Sorry. You're stuck with me for the next 4 Years!"
"<at>StanThe_Man11 Always will be!"
"<at>RipBoy01 Thanks Bro!"
"Spurs' passing is just unreal right now, and Tony Parker is putting on a clinic. OKC has better be ready when they get back home."
"I have no idea what ridiculousness is about <url>e out of <at>RealSkipBayless mouth this morning on FIRST TAKE. But I'm ready. Buckle up! 10am"
"We started FIRST TAKE on ESPNews due to the French Open. We are now on ESPN2."
"<at>BigJD1701 Doesn't mean I said the Miami Heat would get swept!"
"Damn! Damn! Damn! <at>RealSkipBayless is gonna have a field day tomorrow after LBJ missed that last shot. 1st Take will be on ESPNews tomorrow"
"<at>AaronMckee1987 Nope! We had to wait entire careers to get to this point. Why should someone else get a pass? Pay your dues!"
"<at>JoeyLozito Liar! America will never be ready for 2 Brothers like us......TOGETHER!"
"Yo Y'all. I think SNL's Jay Pharoah may bless FIRST TAKE with his presence next week. Hope he does. Would absolutely Freakin Love it!!!"
"Unlike <at>RealSkipBayless I recognize that nothing's over with these Spurs. I picked OKC to win this game, but it'll still get interesting"
"About <url>e on Sportscenter RIGHT NOW for a few minutes before tussling with <at>RealSkipBayless on 1st Take this morning on ESPNews. FYI..."
"The Stephen A. Smith/Ryan Ruocco Show <url>ing at you on 98.7FM on ESPN NY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!"
"<at>YoungWojYaHeard Stop being ignorant. I hold LBJ accountable for a title. THAT'S ALL! What else does he need prove?"
"Haaaaa!!!!!!!!!! What up, Big Boy! Always good to hear from you, Bro!"
"<at>CodyeDaniel24 Nobody's nearly as bad as Tebow. Not even close."
"<at>Simply_Mikeyyy He'll always have an invitation on 1st Take. But I don't believe he'll ever use it so long as Skip is there."
"<at>kingkong217 They just did a month ago. I'm ALL GOOD, BRO. But I do appreciate the love. Thank You."
"<at>WavyAmmar Never once did I call him clutch. I said it doesn't matter if he's clutch because he has D-Wade!"
"<at>Ro29061 He'll beat Manny! Mark my words!"
"<at>emeh68 <at>stephenasmith Ppl like you get on my damn nerves. You're never around when you wrong. But always front and center other times."
"It is bananas down here in OKC -- my first time in this place. And SA's suddenly looking old isn't gonna quiet these folks down one bit."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, if Duncan continues to struggle, San Antonio is not winning this series! Btw, Ginobli and Parker are looking avg, too."
"Umm, in case no one has noticed, SERGE IBAKA AND KENDRICK PERKINS <url>bined for 23 points already -- and it's not even halftime! Trouble"
"Gotta watch the rest of this game and see if San Antonio has just hit a wall! They suddenly look old, tired and immobile. Let's see."
"What a game. But officials helping OKC on a couple of bogus calls."
"Tony Parker is special!"
"Big-Time three by Harden with 9:08 left. Stymied SA's momentum a bit. But this game isn't over yet!"
"OKC has to be careful now. Everyone's making shots for SA Now. Parker, Neal, Diaw. Scoring won't be enough. They've got to get stops!"
"Kevin Durant is a Closer! This is why folks say he's everything LBJ is not. It's what he's doing in the 4th QT. Popovich is looking for ans."
"Can't find it!"
"About <url>e on Sportscenter RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>houston_molinar Never once said anything about color of skin. Does someone pay you to lie for a living or do you just do it for attention?"
"<at>LymonParty I believe LeBron is the best all-around player in the world. I also believe it won't mean a thing until he closes -- and wins."
"This is unbelievable and sad all in the same breath! Miami is being exposed to some degree, and we're left to fantasize: what if Celts......"
"<url>pletely healthy. Pierce, Allen and Avery Bradley!"
"About to do SPORTSCENTER right now before heading over to do 1st Take on ESPNews (until it switches to ESPN2). <at>RealSkipBayless is TICKED!!!"
"FIRST TAKE <url>ing on ESPN2 Following the Tennis Match!"
"Thank you so much, <at>Ash_noelle <at>stephenasmith. Really appreciate it."
"Ask me a question and I'll give you as honest an answer as I possibly can,  <at>aundy_s <at>stephenasmith. No agendas. I say what I mean!"
"Watch your damn mouth :-) <at>AdamSnider14 <at>stephenasmith"
"<at>rashadalaiyan <at>stephenasmith Everything. Been watching it for 36 years -- and counting."
"Thank you so much, <at>BigBooty_Lucy23. And btw....love the twitter name."
"It'll be a struggle, <at>SliverV2 <at>RealSkipBayless <at>KingJames, but I think he'll do it. He'll have no choice. I've done it!"
"<at>JudahKrav actually I didn't forget to mention that. Perhaps if you pulled the wax out of your ears you would've heard that point!"
"When crunch time arrives, when palms get sweaty, certain people step up…"" -<at>stephenasmith on <at>KDTrey5 » <url> "
"It's over. KD and the crew are heading back to OKC to close out the Spurs. Can't see it any other way. Props to Jalen and Tim Legler"
"<at>Dswilling <at>stephenasmith <at>ESPN_FirstTake When you're wrong bro, you're wrong. I'm man enough to admit it."
"The Great Jay Pharaoh of SNL is about to be on LIVE on FIRST TAKE. Don't miss it!"
"<at>kwamkam You were correct!"
"<at>ebrezina29 EXACTLY! Right now....not when D-Wade is on his game. Thank you for quoting me accurately!"
"<at>Clayton793 don't want it right now. Happy doing 1st Take and Sportscenter. It's all I need right now."
"<at>shaneyboy16 You're such a wuss. Where were you when I picked them to win the 1st 2 series? Or Games 3-and-4?"
"I'm about to be on Sportscenter right now. Then after that, I'll go all-in on <at>RealSkipBayless on the Heat. May be best 1ST TAKE EVER!"
"FIRST TAKE is on ESPNews Today.......NOT ESPN2."
"Check out this link: <url>"
"<at>MjTs23 Fair is a place where they judge pigs!"
"<at>jsmith2268 We do. We're friends. Just have absolutely nothing <url>mon!"
"<at>AliShaheedMo language. Goodbye bro. You're officially blocked!"
"I'm on ESPN NY (98.7FM) with my man <at>RyanRuocco from 1-3pm. In other words....RIGHT NOW!!!"
"<at>doriandelph thank you!"
"<at>jbird010 CLEARLY you didn't watch FIRST TAKE. I said the Celts WON the game. 2 hours is better than 4 min. Watch the show on ESPN2 in AM."
"<at>GMENBANKS830 actually, I'm not always yelling. I've been quite cool for a vast majority of this show. It's just easier for you to fib!"
"<at>REAL_RONMEXICO My tune has not changed. He just didn't do a good job last night. But I still believe in him long term!"
"Yeah, I said it, <at>Derek_6_Duque. Nobody's hiding. Everyone knows I WANT Miami to win. I just don't BELIEVE it anymore."
"<at>CityOfChampion2 Tell me about it."
"I'm about to go on Sportscenter at the top of the 6 o'clock hour. Looking for OKC to close the show tonight. Same for the Celts tomorrow."
"Wouldn't mind both teams losing Game 6 -- although I'd love to see an OKC/Miami Finals -- but I just can't see it happening. Disappointing."
"And after much thought, Tivo watching and going IN on D-Wade, I went back and watched Game 5. Don't get what D-Wade says, he's HURT. Knee!"
"There is no way he's losing it in the first half, but not in the 4th QT. He's pacing himself. He's got to go ALL OUT right now. No Tomorrow!"
"As for OKC, Harden's a star. Westbrook's a star. And Durant is whatever the hell he wants to be. Mad respect 2 SA, but I'm a believer in KD."
"I don't know how anybody else feels, but this game is just special. Just special. And MAJOR PROPS to Stephen Jackson. Boy Showed up!!!"
"Speaking of Jackson, that Tech called against him was straight BOGUS. This is why the officiating needs to be addressed."
"Durant is so so Special."
"Stephen Jackson said: ""If you scared, go to church."" Clearly, he's not scared!"
"Special, <at>reggie_bush. This is just something special to see."
"Now Durant is drawing off. Fouls.  Amazing. Btw.......Westbrook has to stop. He's starving so much to be involved offensively, he's F**** up"
"Messin up, that is! Don't want to imply that I'm cussing on Twitter :-)"
"This is just great to see. My man BT is absolutely correct: Greatness Blossoming. And KD did it the right way. Just special!"
"Oh stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless. This game wasn't lost by SA. It was won by Durant and OKC. Special moment. Don't rain on it!"
"OKC handled it's business. Now let's see who'll do it b/t Miami and Boston. FIRST TAKE <url>ing at you right now. ESPNews (10-to-Noon)."
"The re-air to FIRST TAKE will be on after the tennis match on ESPN2."
"I have <url>ment. I'm not in the business of critiquing my colleagues. None of us should be."
"<at>ImRyanMcGuire <at>ESPNNY98_7FM <at>stephenasmith <at>RyanRuocco <at>Chris_Broussard We're on 1-3pm every weekday."
"Just FYI.....my show with Ryan Ruocco is on right now. We're on the air every weekday from 1-3pm EST on the all new ESPN NY (98.7FM)"
"<at>The_JarredIvory <at>stephenasmith Glad you know it. Because I always will."
"<at>LarryTark87 Happy Birthday, bro. Wishing you many, many more healthy ones."
"<at>ACMuzik Yes Sir"
"<at>trusu305 Stop it! You're not robbed when you surrender an 18-point lead inside of 12 minutes."
"<at>Saywhatdude420 And so is your stupidity and bias. They lost. Surrendered an 18-point lead inside of 12 minutes. Get over it."
"<at>Michael_112278 We were talking sports, bro. Not politics. But I hear your point. Some balance would be appreciated."
"<at>JeromeCtheOne <at>KingJames The time for talk is over. These brothers know what time it is. They're either going to do it or not."
"<at>clubalane You're exaggerating on that one. Absolutely no need to bring up race with something so innocuous."
"AMERICA, y'all can say what you want but this is some SPECTACULAR stuff we're seeing from LeBron. SPECTACULAR. Can't say a word right now!!!"
"8:36 left in 3rd. Boston pulls w/in 60-48. Miami TO! LeBron is screaming at coaches to get him the ball as he walks to bench. Damn Right!"
"Stephen A. and Ryan Ruocco on the All New ESPN-NY (98.7FM) is on right now. Talking LeBron, Heat/Celts, Mets/Yankees and more. Buckle Up"
"<at>FloridaMan305 Amen, bro! That's why I showed up in Boston last night. When you're wrong, you're wrong."
"<at>TheStevenBerger <at>CharlizeAfrica Haaaa. I AM a big-time Charlize Theron fan, though."
"Look, nobody has been more critical of LBJ's need to finally capture an NBA Championship, but I can't believe all the hatin'."
"Compare LBJ's performance to anyone, and maybe Jordan's 63-pt display -- or Magic's 42-and-15 in the Finals -- or..........."
"......Jordan's 35 in the 1st half of Game 2 in the Finals vs. Portland and Clyde Drexler. But that's about it."
"Haaaaaaa, <at>fbluke <at>WhitlockJason. I hear your points. I get it."
"That is not true. My thoughts were much <url>plete than that, <at>AthleteLifeee <at>KingJames. Twitter annoys me sometimes just b/c of peeps..."
"like you, <at>AthleteLifeee <at>KingJames. Hate all you want. Just quote me <url>pletely and in context."
"There's still a Game 7 to play, <at>onome222. and <at>KingJames has to finish. Even if it requires help, he has to finish."
"That's the absolute truth, <at>Sarcasm24Seven <at>Victoria27NYC. Most of the NBA do feel Miami is HOLLYWOOD AS HELL. But they respect it."
"Thank you so, so much, <at>onome222 <at>stephenasmith"
"Thank you, <at>mfilisky <at>stephenasmith <at>RealSkipBayless"
"Absolutely, <at>JYanish <at>stephenasmith"
"Keys to 2nite's Game for Miami: D-Wade has GOT to show up early. Can't leave it to LeBron to carry the Heat. Gotta avg more than 5.8 a half."
"For Boston: KG has to get off early. Plus, Doc doesn't need to put Pierce on LBJ if he wants Pierce to deliver buckets."
"I've never seen anything like this is all my years covering the NBA. 1 minute, dudes look like they want to play; another, lost!"
"I know find myself more interested in seeing who'll make a better series for OKC than who'll win Game 7. Pretty damn sad."
"I've got Pacman, <at>skrappack209. I think Bradley's entirely too excited/ antsy, had minimal punching power and is moving up in lbs."
"<at>DonCray78 Then why don't you disappear from my page and follow someone who does?"
"I wouldn't accuse Paul Pierce of flopping, <at>VinnyMays2424 <at>RyanRuocco. He's many things. And a baller is one of them."
"Thank you for acknowledging that, <at>KidTakeOff. That's exactly what I will always do because that is who I am. Always!!!"
"It should, <at>JTsteez <at>RyanRuocco"
"Not offended at all, <at>giantsfan719. Although it's not true I can certainly admit it appears that way. I'm good with the criticism."
"Not true, <at>Blessit2009 <at>RyanRuocco"
"If you're rooting for the Miami Heat, here's what should concern you: Rondo 10 Assists, zero TO's. Both Pierce and Allen are"
"shooting 50% or better. And the Celtics are still up 7 after KG had to go to the bench with 6:50 left after picking up his 3rd foul. Uh Oh!"
"And btw...in case no one has noticed, Ray Allen's stroke is looking very, very sweet. The Heat look lethargic, disinterested. Very Bad!"
"No matter what's happening in this game, remember Miami's supporting cast flows with the tempo LeBron and D-Wade set."
"LeBron and D-Wade have got to do something. They just can't leave it to Battier and Chalmers to try and drain 3's. In fact, I think"
"I think Spoelstra needs to put in Norris Cole. Just someone to push the ball up the floor and provide ENERGY. Miami just looks dry."
"I don't care that D-Wade just hit that jumper. I'm watching Heat' players bumping into 1-another, tripping, etc. What the Hell?"
"However, now that it's tied up, let's see what they'll do with things from here. Talk to y'all later."
"I'm en route to OKC and I can't wait until for the NBA Finals. LeBron vs. Durant. D-Wade vs. Westbrook and Harden. Lovin' it"
"Honestly, though, I'm proud of <at>KingJames. He's balled. But there's no way around it: He still has to finish. If Durant wins...."
"Where will LeBron go from here? While we question if Miami will get better, we KNOW KD and OKC will. The road only gets harder for Miami."
"Oh, BTW.....haven't had a chance to see Bradley/Pacquaio yet. If it's robbery like folks say, something needs to be done w/ Boxing!"
"I am so sick and damn tired of these bogus decisions. Let UFC's Dana White take over and just start giving folks fights we want 2 C."
"Nothing secret about it, <at>evancraig1. I'd love for <at>KingJames to win it all. Just don't believe it's happening vs. KD and OKC."
"D-Wade never had Westbrook's speed, <at>madhwn. And Westbrook doesn't have D-Wade's poise, gears and b-ball IQ."
"Can you kiss off or go to someone else's twitter page and tell them what to do, <at>104stang???"
"I'd pick me for the George Jefferson role, <at>TheEdfromVegas <at>leecrowe <at>hosienation. Especially w/ the Funky Chicken :-)"

"Yes Sir, I do, <at>akaDaLo <at>KingJames <at>DwyaneWade <at>MiamiHEAT. I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it."
"Forgot to reach out to you and say thanks for that interview, <at>Wale. Enjoyed it, bro. See you down the line!"
"A moment to send my condolences to my boy, <at>NYJayBee, as die-hard as a Mets' fan as I know. Swept by my Yankees AGAIN! So sorry!"
"Hoping to see you in OKC, <at>LilTunechi. If there's anything I can do for you, I happily will."
"All I know, <at>TheRealMikeEpps, is that you don't need to be talking about my hairline more like you did in Dallas :-) Much love, bruh!"
"Just giving credit where credit is due, <at>Patches_MC"
"Can't wait to see it, <at>wale. Looking forward to it!"
"Yours truly and <at>RealSkipBayless LIVE from Oklahoma City for FIRST TAKE ALL WEEK LONG. Do I need to say anymore!!!!!!!!! Buckle Up!!!!"
"Then it is his fault because he SHOULD know better by now, <at>OGPerryIV"
"Sadly! <at>pussyandpills <at>RealSkipBayless"

"Thanks, bro! <at>VegaHeat6 <at>RealSkipBayless"
"I DO believe it, <at>BtEarls_33. That's the only reason I picked OKC. I never root vs. <at>DwyaneWade. But I truly believe OKC is better"
"<at>king21luis I don't miss points on B-Ball, bro. I know exactly what I said."
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, <at>DDJMat. That's hilarious."
"Actually, I don't feel like I'm overboard at all, <at>LBJFanInNYC. I meant every word I said."
"Yep! <at>VegasSilk. And I still don't believe it will be enough to beat OKC."
"Don't blame <at>HBO or any network for the state of Boxing, <at>JmartinezLTF. It's not anyone else's fault. Boxing can't do this."
"They can't continue to get away with hoodwinking us, <at>JmartinezLTF. Give us the fights we want to see and be fair. Not too much to ask."
"No dynasties until they win a chip, <at>LGFrisbeeguy"
"<at>MattSapaula Thanks Bro!"
"FIRST <url>ing at you right now...LIVE from Oklahoma City. And <at>RealSkipBayless is in the house. Won't help him today, though. ESPN2! Haa"

"Pul-leeze <at>Frankiieeee_"
"who cares? <at>ll_c0ol_Dre"

"oooooohhhhhhh, <at>MinkaKen. That's a good one."
"Tell'em you love me, Girl! <at>liahLS <at>stephenasmith"
"Odds are slim for Miami, <at>BIGCROY <at>stephenasmith <at>KingJames <at>DwyaneWade. I'm just being real about it. Hope I'm wrong, but doubt it."
"Pick it now, girl! <at>KIARAorCHRISSY <at>stephenasmith. You want a brother to AGREE with you OR KEEP IT REAL WITH YOU? Pick it!!!"
"Not fair, <at>ShazamW0W. <at>DwyaneWade did not say it like that. You're misrepresenting his words."
"Problem?<at>VSholokhova <at>rel_e12 <at>stephenasmith"
"Is it that? <at>rjtrules. Or were you just rude in your approach to folks and got checked?....<at>ShazamW0W <at>DwyaneWade"

"Somebody has to, <at>aries_327 <at>stephenasmith"
"Without question......we'll give Durant his due, <at>melyssa23 <at>stephenasmith <at>KDTrey5 <at>KingJames. It's not like we'd have a choice"
"I hope <at>KingJames wins, <at>TheErikFox. I truly do! But I don't see it happening in this series. OKC is just too potent... <at>stephenasmith"
"Listen more, you'll agree more,<at>impaktDIGGS <at>stephenasmith"
"Actually, not true, <at>HaffLauren <at>stephenasmith. Just the conference finals. But you're right: That's bad enough."
"Durant, <at>tluddy24 <at>stephenasmith"
"<at>Coopa_Troopa12 <at>stephenasmith Yes!"
"True Dat (haaaaaa!!!!!!!) <at>SlimkidTDB <at>Sma5h_n_Thra5H <at>juggathaMOTM"

"Not true. <at>KingRich260 <at>stephenasmith"
"Get over it, <at>ConnorBowen13 <at>stephenasmith. My prediction doesn't change what Miami's going to do. I'm not playing; they are."
"No sir! <at>MellRoy_Jetson <at>stephenasmith"
"No he is not, <at>THEDOCOFTHEDAWN <at>RyanRuocco <at>stephenasmith <at>KingJames. But that doesn't mean he doesn't need to be."
"Clearly, you do NOT like me, <at>jassi2354 <at>stephenasmith"
"<at>alloydesq Moms, too??? I had no idea!"
"What the hell do you mean you don't know <at>Shaq. Are you watching this? Durant is PURE! Ice! Money!"

"Obviously that's true, <at>gregkeown23. The facts state as much. The question was: is it fair or foul. And it's FOUL, <at>stephenasmith"
"D-Wade has shown up, but he needs to do more, <at>2JSilv8990 <at>SASBMJ <at>RealSkipBayless <at>DwyaneWade. What he's doing won't be enough!"
"I've said that to Skip on many occasions, <at>mstover311 <at>RealSkipBayless. But we're talking about Skip here. No hope!"
"This is the son of Michael Jordan????<at>Hater_ThatsMe <at>SASBMJ"
"Huh? What? Seriously? <at>pghazal <at>LilTunechi. Lil' Wayne looked cool to me sitting courtside."

"Feel Free, <at>TheRealAWarsame"
"He would need to, <at>umee1989. I'm rooting <at>KingJames. I DO NOT want him to fail. But he's got to do it and <at>DwyaneWade must help him."

"Ab-so-freakin-lutely, <at>Whitestkidalive <at>stephenasmith"

"<at>NOTyo_uncleTHO Who cares?"
"Those are the same folks <url>plain about peeps not being real enough, <at>BTroyXXL. Tell'em to appreciate honesty. Stop Whining!"

"You're not worth the time, <at>cjt0805"
"Sorry! Calling in 2 Hours bro!"
"I'm brilliant, bruh, because I KNOW I'M NOT. I learn from others, <at>cjt0805. U R too much of a hater to notice I always say that."
"Truth be told, I don't think <at>HEAT will ever trade <at>Dwyane Wade, <at>DeAndre_pete. And neither would I. Just don't think they win NOW!"
"But I truly do believe <at>DwyaneWade <url>e back next year stronger than ever, <at>DeAndre_pete. He's that kind <url>petitor."
"I'm not always right, <at>vberardinelli1. Just most of the time."
"You should! <at>DishonWJohnson"
"I can't speak on what's going to happen in the 2nd Half. But Westbrook looks awful. Gotta get it together."
"I won't lie. I can't believe how awful Westbrook has played tonight. He's making <at>RealSkipBayless look like a straight-up prophet!!!"
"No doubt KD was fouled by <at>KingJames on that last play. But LBJ played his butt off. 12-for-12 FT's were huge, too. Give it up 2nite."
"As for OKC, two sickening pts: Thunder came in w/o urgency, like they had the damn game. And Westbrook was HORRIBLE! Zero Floor leadership!"
"Westbrook is 23. I believe in him and his skills. But he's GOT to play better. If OKC loses these Finals, it will be because of HIM."
"As for <at>DwyaneWade, he was better tonight. Like I said, he's warming up for Game 3, where he'll explode. But Miami MUST WIN 2-of-3.."
"IN MIAMI. They must go back to OKC up 3-2 to win the NBA Championship. Nothing less will get it done. <url>e to the NBA Finals, everyone."
"Goodnight. Don't forget to catch FIRST TAKE tomorrow morning. I'll try to make it easier for all of us to stomach <at>RealSkipBayless."
"Remember, <at>RealSkipBayless called Miami to win Game 2. He said it would NOT be because of <at>KingJames. But expect selective amnesia 2 kick in"
"Yeah! <at>RealSkipBayless and I got into it. B/t <at>KingJames, Westbrook and Lil' Wayne, what do y'all expect? FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 at top of hour"
"Stop smoking so early in the morning, <at>questions2_t3"
"Clearly, you don't watch the show, <at>CooperCooper1. It's not me you have to worry about!"
"Yes I do, <at>BtEarls_33"
"<at>SwaggerLikeBubs <at>espn Goodbye!"

"Yeah, but I'm not looking good so far, <at>fearGRAYtness. I picked OKC to win this in 6 games. They may lose in 5 if they keep messing up."

"That's right Westbrook: TAKE OVER! He's the only one on OKC who really seems to want it. Everyone else is FOLDING!"
"Harden! What a sorry performance. Another missed shot. And Durant! You're down 3 with a minute left and you give it up to SEFOLOSHA! Oh Damn"
"Can't argue with you today, <at>IAmSteveHarvey. You're absolutely right. Still think OKC's the better team. But destiny is calling. LeBron!"

"To all you Knicks' fans out there, what does LeBron winning a title do to the Knicks: <url>"

"I don't know what you're talking about, <at>REALANTOINEFAIR. Jalen is my boy. We get along just fine. And he's <url>ed on FIRST TAKE anytime."
"Yep, <at>FDelaware. Ain't that a damn shame!"
"Actually, I'd love to see a Game 7, <at>TwoWordsForYa. But I just don't think we're getting out of Miami."
"The game isn't over yet, but this is unbelievable. Chalmers, Cole and battier hitting 3's. And MIKE MILLER of all ppl. What's is going on!!!"
"What's up with all the hairline jokes, bro (haaaa!!!!!!!), <at>ImTracyMorgan"
"Today, <at>RealSkipBayless has to MAN UP and give it up to <at>KingJames. And I can't wait. FIRST <url>ing at you, 10-to-Noon EST on ESPN2."
"Btw.......Dallas Mavs' owner Mark Cuban is in the house!"
"Puh-leeze, <at>VarandK <at>stephenasmith <at>mcuban. You definitely weren't watching."
"<at>nickgagliano <at>stephenasmith Thanks bro."
"My man <at>RyanRuocco is on ESPN New York (98.7FM) with yours truly right now until 3pm today. Talking <at>KingJames and more. 800.919.3776."
"Congrats on a great NBA Finals, <at>MagicJohnson. The <at>MiamiHEAT -- a 1st-class franchise led by your boy Riles -- truly deserved it."
"<at>Iconic_Baller <at>stephenasmith Thank you."
"<at>ginovalentino <at>stephenasmith Absolutely. You're correct. No argument here."
"<at>Kobestilldabest <at>stephenasmith He'll need help."
"<at>Viper10701 <at>stephenasmith I'll miss you, too :-)"
"<at>n_hayes1 <at>stephenasmith Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>B_Maher845 <at>stephenasmith Yes he is, sir. To his players, his personnel and the people HE cares about? Yes, he most certainly is."
"<at>tevantru15 <at>stephenasmith No! WTH is wrong with YOU?"
"Thank you so much, <at>TaurusBone"
"<at>KING_DJeezy <at>stephenasmith Yes Lawd!"
"<at>Fisheplaya <at>stephenasmith <at>MagicJohnson <at>MiamiHEAT Before Chauncey Billups got hurt. Not after."
"I try to be bro, <at>johnadeleon"
"<at>voguntolu Thank you sir!"
"It's beautiful to be here at Citi Field for this Yankees/Mets rubber match. But even better to see Swisher smack that 3-run shot. BEAUTIFUL!"
"<at>MichaelRosales6 Hopefully we will from time-to-time!"
"Sorry I neglected to tell y'all that FIRST TAKE was only on from 10-11am today and it's on ESPNews......NOT ESPN2!!!"
"<at>Jakellz you have to play for a city that cares if you're to have any pressure applied."
"<at>TylerWorden13 No!"
"Initially, I didn't like this: <url> that much. Certainly not better than ""All He Does Is Win Games."" But it's grown on me."
"Just a reminder: a special edition of FIRST TAKE is airing on ESPN at 7pm TONIGHT! Subject: NBA Draft. <at>RealSkipBayless is waiting for you!"
"In case you wanted a hint about what's gonna be on today's FIRST TAKE, here ya go: <url> It's on ESPNews today from 10-11pm."
"<at>BABA37638873 <url>pletely agree. I don't believe I'm a Big Deal at all."
"Here's what people like <at>Codmw32 don't get about my position on Tebow: I like the kid. I respect him. I just don't think he can throw. But.."
"what folks don't get is that when I bring up the Black Athlete, it's in DEFENSE of what them. My point: There are many God-Fearing, decent"
"athletes out there. Guys who are God-fearing, who never got in trouble, who believed in being role models. What shine did they get? Who"
"celebrated them? And when you're so quick to celebrate Tebow, what exactly are ppl trying to say? That he's the first? Puh-leeze. The point:"
"<at>TimTebow is not the first Good Guy and he won't be the last. Many preceded him. To ignore this is an insult to all of us. But especially"
"the Black Athlete who was out here long before him, living right, and never received the shine nor the opportunities accorded to him. Simple"
"And for those who didn't like what I just said, I could give less than a you know what. I said it and I mean every damn word of it."
"And Yes! I DID use more than 140 characters. Because I wanted to. Goodbye!!! See y'all tomorrow on FIRST TAKE at 10 a.m."
"Urgent! Urgent. Ladies and Gentlemen. This is the real STEPHEN A. SMITH from ESPN. Please be aware there is a FAKE Stephen A out here who"
"Who's been reporting FALSE trade rumors. I have not reported anything. I am NOT covering the NBA Draft. Please be advised IT'S NOT ME!"
"And be aware of these individuals doing this. Again, I have not reported ANYTHING. No trades, pre-draft transactions, NOTHING! Any reporting"
"I do will take place over the airwaves of ESPN. Not on Twitter. Please be advised!!!"
"<at>MrVietNguyen I wouldn't know."
"<at>PrinceTray The operative word is ""seem."" You celarly don't ""know"" what you're talking about b/c that's not true."
"<at>Mamba_Negro_RN Life!"
"<at>BBNewsHound Ignorance. His beef was with Skip. What show were you watching?"
"<at>Grugz29 And I love y'all back. Especially in Sydney."
"<at>Mray20 Don't you even dear!"
"About to be on SPORTSCENTER right now. Talking USA Basketball, Celtics, Lamar Odom to the Clippers and more. Check it out!"
"Hope everyone enjoys their 4th of July. I'm off this week on vacation, but I WILL be back on Monday. Enjoy. Be safe. Don't drink and drive!"
"<at>KellzC5 pleasure was all mine!"
"I'm officially off vacation tomorrow morning when I return to Sportscenter at 10am. But I'm not missing Silva vs. Sonnen in UFC TONIGHT."
"This is <url>petition is all about. I don't bet against Silva. But he can't underestimate this guy. Sonnen's no joke. But Silva's the man"
"Damn! I've been looking so much forward to this fight, now that it's here...I'M NERVOUS. I want Silva to win. But I want a good fight!"
"Damn Anderson! Didn't think Sonnen would get him to the ground that early! I hate fights like this. Ground-and-pound. Neutralizes Silva!"
"Looks like a repeat of Fight #1 to me. I want to see what Sonnen can do standing up with Anderson! But doesn't look like that's gonna happen"
"Anderson's gotta find a way to stop fighting from his back. Damn!"
"Yyyeeeeaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!! You talk it, you've gotta walk it!"
"One thing needs to be said: all these UFC fighters have a lot of class. Love how they uplift their sport. I root for this sports popularity!"
"<at>buffandsweet33 Thanks Bro!"
"Fyi......I am officially off of vacation. Return on 1st Take tomorrow to pound down <at>RealSkipBayless and show up on Sportscenter. Lots 2 say"
"All this NBA talk. NFL. MLB. Just can't wait. Haven't been this fired up in quite a long time. So buckle up and get ready. <url>ing!"
"You wouldn't dare, <at>DonLegreca. You wouldn't dare :-)"
"Haaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>mikecstarr When I have the slightest idea what the hell you're talking about, I'll be sure to let you know!"
"Okay, your boy is back. I'm loving what I'm seeing in Brooklyn, lukewarm about NY and feeling sorry for Mark Cuban in Dallas. Loving LA, BTW"
"Although OKC is still the best in the West, the Lakers are actually the ones with the best shot to beat Miami -- the favorites -- next year."
"Nash is a scoring threat, frees up Kobe and will make Bynum and Gasol happy. LA in the Finals turns Miami into a perimeter team. No Good MIA"
"In the East, can't sleep on Boston. Terry in place of Allen is not a huge drop off. But letting Allen get away to Miami? OOHHHH!!!"
"As for Knicks, let's stop it please. Love Kidd, but he's beyond his prime. Lin will need lots of tutoring. And Amare's health is the key."
"Until we know for sure that Amare's back and knees are healthy, Brooklyn has the best team in NY."
"As for Dallas, after losing Tyson Chandler, you lose Kidd and Terry and don't nab Deron Williams. I'll say this: Carlisle  deserves better."
"No need for me to go any further, for now. Check me out on FIRST TAKE tomorrow morning with <at>RealSkipBayless, after I'm on SPORTSCENTER."
"BTW....for all you ESPN New York (98.7FM) Radio lovers out there, I'll be filling in for Michael Kay all week long from 3-6pm."
"<at>allaboutfigures Couldn't see <at>KingJames once Chael got dropped. But he couldn't have been more hyped than me."
"<at>In_Koolwetrust Nothing. Especially if they don't get Eric Gordon."
"Why do I even try to reach <at>RealSkipBayless? I don't know why I try to talk Basketball with this man on FIRST TAKE!"
"<at>JerryNyPr Not promoting. Just talking on Radio about how I feel. It's called doing my job."
"<at>90sKnicksFans <at>IamBrianJ <at>TheHonorableHaS You're lying. Because you don't have any."
"For folks walking around all ecstatic about your NY Knicks, here's something to think about: <url>"
"Wow! <at>RealSkipBayless. I've got to admit, Cano was just embarrassing! Can't deny it!"
"<at>ForrestLoveFood <at>realskipbayless <at>ThessoloniusO <at>LaMolllly :-):-):-)"
"<at>MadmanSteve12 Haaaaa. I loved it!"
"<at>Mikey_Boyy didn't mean that the way it sounded. Don't know her at all."
"<at>FrankMc20 Turn the channel, bro! No problem here."
"<at>iamedgar_ That would be correct."
"<at>CoachMicah Idiocy. I happen to respect Mario Chalmers. Clearly you've ignored my 20-year track record. Too bad you don't have 1 <url>pare."
"<at>jak20rabt <at>ndstacken I'm not Vegan. Trust me."
"<at>Jake_Dip Thank you. Deeply appreciate the kind words."
"<at>hleezyfbaby <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>realskipbayless Haaaaaaaa."
"<at>hleezyfbaby <at>ESPN_FirstTake <at>RealSkipBayless Get over it. If we disagree on every single thing, it would be phony. We're real. Enjoy it."

"<at>ThPowersProject Thanks bro."
"<at>jmcman13 I'm sure I'll get over losing you, sir."
"<at>Sweenbean Study everything. Be relentless."
"<at>Cleve444 Love on Tebow. Better to sound like I lover than a hater."
"<at>MaisonMargiela <at>90sKnicksFans And what do you do to get people to listen to you? Don't bother answering."
"<at>xXBAMAXx Nash is a significant upgrade."
"Always great working with you, <at>DonLagreca."
"<at>KellzC5 Happy Birthday, Ms. Franklin Hospital :-)"
"<at>BradPhillips252 <at>RealSkipBayless Nope!"
"<at>Thera_P <at>ESPN_FirstTake Yes Sir."
"<at>DICKfrm_TheNICK Damn Skippy."
"<at>Dick_Hardwood Crack Smoker."
"<at>JohnGeromanos <at>RealSkipBayless The man has problems."
"<at>jordanweibel24 Amen."
"<at>TRUPATSFAN75 <at>RealSkipBayless You know you watched. Stop acting like you didn't."
"<at>siralex6 I agree. But he could be defended by this crew. Sort of like Steve Novak was against the Heat in the 1st Round :-) Only playing!"
"Let me be clear about my feelings on Penn State. This is about SEXUAL MOLESTATION. Anyone quick to jump to Joe Pa's or PSU's defense should"
"be ashamed of themselves. Children were victimized. That's the bottom line. Nothing else matters. The only thing we should be talking about"
"is when will PSU's football program will receive THE DEATH PENALTY. At least a 5-five ban. Period."
"Remember this: even hard-core criminals in jail know better than harming children. It's a damn disgrace. A damn disgrace."
"<at>CleverMrWright You're pathetic. Get the hell off my twitter page."
"<at>realdavidfarr I won't bother saying what you are. I'll just say goodbye."
"<at>TheKingofLeo You're absolutely correct. It is dumb."
"<at>stein411 You're clearly an insensitive idiot who deserves nothing else said to you on this matter. Goodbye."
"<at>DeeFlyHigh360 Way to go, bro."
"Amen Girl!"
"<at>duranasaurus <at>RealSkipBayless We're all censored to some degree, bro."

"<at>CliffHami210 It's ALL OF OUR responsibility!"
"<at>_iBePaperChasin would you? :-)"
"Nice to watch USA Basketball. They started out cold with their perimeter shooting, but we all know the DR has no chance. Probably 40-pt win."
"<at>lem0324 Thank you, sir!"
"My boy <at>RyanRuocco and yours truly <url>ing at you on ESPN NY (98.7FM) Radio right now. With you until 3p.m. Holla at your boys."
"Just to reiterate, no of us should let go of this Penn State Story. Not until the Death Penalty is issue to their football program and......"
"Joe Paterno's statue is removed. Let the players transfer immediately. Attach an extra year of eligibility to their careers. Just make sure"
"there's no football at Penn State for the foreseeable future. Minimum next five years."
"<at>joeycarb Can't worry about those few at the expense of this situation. The lives of the many always outweigh the lives of the few."
"<at>startwbmart The best thing to do is get rid of the problem. let the players go play elsewhere. Take care of them. Damn the football program"
"<at>MikeD46 <at>startwbmart I can't call you what you are. ESPN doesn't want me using such language."
"<at>Apizzle24 <at>EvanHoke24 How about you stick to ignorance."
"<at>DaveMoney323 You're a disgrace. Think about what you just said. What you're talking about. You should be ashamed of yourself."
"<at>adiddy4real Tell that to all those kids who were molested,.....scarred for the rest of their lives."
"<at>E_wavey You should be ashamed of yourself. Seriously."
"<at>Carlino27 You want get the chance. I told dudes like you about your mouth on my twitter page. you didn't listen. Goodbye."
"I never said that in my life about Amar'e, <at>schimshady247. The only thing I've ever questioned is his health. Must be another fake account."
"Jeremy Lin/Knicks are likely no more. Let's talk. Special Edition of Stephen A. Smith Show on ESPN NY (98.7FM) 1pm EST. TODAY."
"I'm getting very annoyed with all this Jeremy Lin stuff already. A special edition of the Stephen A. Smith Show <url>ing NOW"
"More on Jeremy Lin. Check it out on Sportscenter at 6pm. Check it out!"
"Y'all know what time it is. Don't act like you don't know. FIRST TAKE'S in the Hooooouuuussseeeee!!!!!!!!! On ESPN2 right now!"
"All this talk about Lin, like he's the <url>ing of Chris Paul is ridiculous. Stop it! <url>"
"<at>Huarlin24 You sir, are a highly intelligent young man!"
"<at>KEVINBUFF7488 slava."
"Here's a peek at today's Podcast for 1st Take. Feel free to check it out: <url>"
"<at>Stevenkovo8 Yes you do!"
"<at>theeMANual Damn Right!"
"Skip's on the prowl. First <url>ing at you on ESPN2 right now!!!"
"<at>pope_on_dope Thanks bro."
"<at>RikSweeting Haaaaa. You're right. Didn't realize it until after I was done."
"<at>aed24 Man, If I respond to everybody I wouldn't have time to perform my job. I respond when i can. Sorry if that's not good enough."
"<at>patrickdunn <at>ESPN_FirstTake Just for a segment here, my dude. Nothing permanent. But I miss my man, Jay."
"<at>bubuhuang What does this mean?"
"Knicks' brass has already decided to let Jeremy Lin head to Houston. But that doesn't mean owner Dolan won't change his mind by 11:50 2nite."
"We'll see what happens. Lin is no scrub, but I'm not losing sleep over the thought of him leaving. He doesn't make them better than Miami,"
"Chicago, Boston or even Brooklyn. So we'll see how things go down. My man <at>RyanRuocco and yours truly are talking about it on ESPN New York"
"(98.7FM) on our radio show. We'll see how it all goes down. Talk to y'all later."
"About to be on Sportscenter right now for 2 min before letting loose on FIRST TAKE at 10am on ESPN2."
"Just to let folks know what was on my mind BEFORE First Take began this morning: <url>"
"I know that Jeremy Lin is not longer a Knick. Oh Well: <url>"
"<at>JaValeMcGee34 Good luck, Bro! Put in the work and you could be one of the best in the game!"
"<at>TheYoungOG Thanks my man."
"<at>TruthDAWG_09 No doubt."
"<at>MJCKayne Yet, you watch us anyway. So what does that say about you? Don't bother answering. You're not that important."
"<at>LoganAck23 <at>RealSkipBayless Damnit, we love you back."
"<at>adamtraweek And you're ignorant. So I guess that means we've both got problems. I'm sure I'll get over it. You? I'm not so sure."
"<at>One_Deep_Rich Yes, I do."
"<at>Scotte2hotte07 I guess if they were black, you WOULDN'T be, huh? Since it's so easy for you to point out others racial tendencies."
"Thank you so much, <at>DERIIFOUNDATION. May God Bless you and your family as well as he's blessed mine. Today. And everyday."
"<at>spidertcg31 I'm sure he'll get over it."
"Folks are getting on my damn nerves. Lin is OKAY. The Knicks didn't lose the <url>ing of Chris Paul. Plus, folks are missing the boat:"
"Lin's departure puts the pressure on Melo and Amar'e. They've got to step up and get it done. No excuses. No time to waste. It's about NOW!!"
"Neither Melo, Amar'e nor anyone else with the Knicks will have the luxury of being distracted by LinSanity. It's not going to be about him."
"It's going to be about ballers, highly paid ones, who are suppose to step up and ball. It's time for Melo to show us more. For Amar'e to"
"earn his dollars. For the Knicks to advance beyond the First Round in the playoffs. W/ or w/o Lin, it should happen. Period."
"As for D-Howard, he should've been in B'klyn. That's his fault. And now that that appears out of the question, Lakers should be the place."
"But more importantly, D-Howard needs to man-up and speak on his own behalf instead of letting folks provide stuff on ticker and twitter."
"He needs to speak up for himself and stop letting others define his image/character. He needs to do it himself. Stop running and hiding."
"It's time! He can't soft-ball and laugh his way out of all this mess. If he didn't create this mess, he needs to say so and why, and move on"
"For those of you who didn't see my column on Jeremy Lin's departure from the Knicks, no need to go any further: <url>  "
"<at>steve_2_smooth Thank you."
"<at>HenrySchilling I don't believe I'm always mean."
"<at>Johnny11Vegas Then why does <url> already have more than a million hits? Please know what you're talking about. Don't debate the master:)"
"<at>Hoopsking1968 <at>RyanRuocco Huh? What are you talking about?"
"<at>DaisyCutter79 Yep!"
"<at>RealAMart <at>RealSkipBayless Yes Sir."
"<at>ZacLynady <at>RealSkipBayless No sir. In my case, it's because I don't watch it religiously. so I don't want to be unfair. I speak of what I C"
"<at>firststurg haaaaaaa!!!!!!!"
"<at>CMallory7 Takes one to know one!"
"My thoughts on today: Adam Scott's collapse is great for golf. So is Tiger's 3rd-place finish. Dream Team struggled, but it happens."
"Also....absolutely can't wait to hear what the NCAA does to Penn State. DEATH PENALTY is warranted here. Plus, some NFL players need to be"
"Checked, as well. There must always be law and order. Too many folks are not realizing that. Damn Shame!"
"<at>WestsideCorna Sad that you'd waste your time on such futile efforts."
"<at>FakeEspys Damn! I didn't win that honor yet? :;)"
"<at>DBarnes_18 because it's not about you. It's about the molestation of Children and the institution that allowed it to happen. You know this."
"<at>T_Pott2 Not even a little bit. In my perfect world, all those wonderful students would choose another school to avoid the stain caused."
"<at>T_Pott2 Told you about your language. Another one bites the dust!"
"Check out this new promo for FIRST TAKE with me and <at>RealSkipBayless: <url> Before you watch us live at 10am on ESPN2. NOW!!"
"<at>Ciroc_Obama I guess you're blind....since you clearly haven't seen the interviews I've done over the last 20 years!"
"Check out my boy <at>RyanRuocco with yours truly on the all new ESPN New York (98.7FM) right now."
"<at>DSchriber You first."
"<at>KimboKevin <at>Ludacris I'm not ashamed of that. Ludacris is a good-looking brother. We're good."
"<at>Ty_Yost <at>RealSkipBayless Then you need to go and get a Webster's dictionary to learn the true meaning of the word."
"No sir, <at>_Marcotte_. <at>RealSkipBayless and myself are two dudes debating sports like everyone else. Don't hate b/c you're not doing it."
"<at>OkoriWadsworth I'll listen once someone explains to me how <url>parable to the damage done to those kids."
"<at>LebronLuv <at>_Marcotte_ <at>RealSkipBayless You're qualified."
"<at>LogicalHater <at>TheSiThL0Rd <at>AngryBlkManDC You know it, bro!"
"<at>ortizme93 Appreciate the kind words, my man."
"My man John Saunders is on with me and <at>RyanRuocco right now <url>pletely agrees with me. Makes me feel even better about my stance. Not.."
"that I need anybody's help on this matter."
"<at>Ptjgd Far from it. Registered Independent. Social Moderate/Fiscal Conservative."
"<at>jeter1111 shame on you."
"<at>jeter1111 Not at that cost. I can assure you of that. ESPN would never tolerate such a thing. Never."
"<at>Lance_THESPOKEN I give anyone credit who deserves it. My name is not <at>RealSkipBayless."
"Look Damnit! I've stated my position. I wish PSU were fined $200-million instead of just $60 million. I hope the kids/Coaches transfer."
"CHILDREN were raped. Molested. And folks turned a blind eye/deaf ear to what was going on. There's nothing to discuss here. NOTHING AT ALL."
"<at>haileyy_xoxo Leave, then."
"<at>RyanJaquith <at>jemelehill Both"
"<at>DwyaneWade Hopefully, your host will be at least half as funny as he was last year! (Haaaa)!!!!"

"<at>JoeScalo You'd be correct.....assuming I wasn't the host last year! Do your homework."
"<at>hectorlabella language. Goodbye!"
"<at>realmacjuanda14 I find it amusing that you actually think you know anything about me at all."

"<at>troymjenkins I won't miss you. Trust me!"
"<at>juice33nyc I was the Host last year! Continue to be ignorant!"
"I am so sick and tired of the 2012 Dream Team being disrespected. Maybe Jordan/Pippen would stop them. But they're legit. Deserves respect."
"That's just one of the topics. There's more with me and <at>RealSkipBayless. Check out FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 right now!!!!!! Buckle Up!"
"<at>raphy68 Perhaps. But his (in)action was reprehensible, insensitive and cowardly and selfish. Live with it, but that will never change."

"<at>JoeScrilla No worries."
"Haaaaaaa!!!! God Rest his soul!"
"Wait a minute, <at>wedelmichael. I haven't disrespected <at>DezBryant. I said He's in the news for wrong reasons and no man should hit their Mom."
"If that's disrespecting <at>DezBryant, I'm sorry, <at>wedelmichael. But I'll be damned if I change my mind on that. Ain't happen!"
"FIRST TAKE'S in the house. On ESPN2 RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!"
"Thanks!"
"<at>CloudKcker you should feel like he touched yours. We're talking innocent children here. Sad to see you don't have the heart to see that!"

"<at>tvjunki33 <at>stephenasmith <at>JonVilma51 You stand behind someone being stupid enough to ignore their boss when he's called to the office?"
"Always, <at>MrEdLover. Always good to hear from you. Keep in touch and let me know if you need anything."
"Let's get something straight, <at>sabirah156 <at>MrEdLover. I'm NEVER rude to anybody. But I'm not into the celebrity. Not at all."
"I eat, bleed and go to the bathroom like everybody else, <at>sabirah156. Ask my boy, <at>MrEdLover. I do not get caught up. Never have, never will"

"Tune in, or click on <url> and click on."
"<at>Rob_Rozay How do you think I feel about it?"
"Hey! Maybe I've changed my feelings about <at>TimTebow after talking to him today. I really don't know <at>RealSkipBayless.  <url>"
"Haaaaaa!!!!!! Before y'all react READ THE COLUMN!"

"<at>SteveP_201 Look at the Jets' receivers. I heard Terrell Owens ran a 4.3. The dude is 38 years old. Give the man his props, and a job."
"<at>brewers_GM It's called a <url>puter. Something I use to prevent me from being bored beating down <at>RealSkipBayless."
"Amen <at>Shaq. They were awsome. All of them. Hail to the NEW FAB FIVE!!!"

"<at>Pboyz4 <url>ment."
"<at>airbornchris I hear you. But we're 2 hours. 10 minutes on Tebow -- while nauseating for ME -- doesn't define the show. We do more than that"

"Oh, Stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless. You know better. Just stop it!"
"<at>t_upham Stop drug user. It's not good for you. Clearly you're on something if you think for a second we're scripted!"
"<at>RetroFutureView it's inappropriate for me to say right now in light of the Aurora, Colo. Shooting!"
"Let's all take a moment to sent our heartfelt condolences to Coach Andy Reid and his family for their loss. A pain all of wish to avoid."
"I'm on vacation folks. But I'll be back on Monday, ready to go. Don't worry: I'll hear everything. And I will RESPOND. Just not this week:-)"
"Oh, btw.....I love my man Rob Parker like a brother. But his outfit today was an ABOMINATION! Like all the others (haaa)"

"Barring any last minute snag, D-Howard will be a Laker by tomorrow. Bynum will be in Philly. And we'll all expect a Lakers/Heat Finals."
"Unless OKC or the Clippers have something to say to the Lakers. Only Boston has a chance of derailing the Heat in the East!!!"
"Not so fast, <at>SnoopDogg. OKC and Miami may have something to say about that!"
"No doubt, my man!"
"<at>gborror1972 Gotta think about that. I'm inclined to say Yes, considering the rings."
"Good Call, <at>JalenRose. Go ahead and block'em. It's very liberating :-)"
"No problem, <at>BShellz30. Get a degree, put 20 years in the business and climb the ladder like the rest of us and we'll gladly debate you!"
"I was born ready for <at>RealSkipBayless,  <url>ediansims. You ain't said nothing but a word!"

"<at>LojikReazon <at>stephenasmith <at>RealSkipBayless <at>ESPNCindyB <at>ESPN_FirstTake She is pretty-damn good."
"That's right, I said it: Tebow gives the Jets the best chance to win. Look at their receivers. Their passing game. All they can do is RUN!!!"
"Thank you Dear!"
"<at>Quise4Prezident Yes! Until the Jets get some receivers."
"<at>TimmyKing182 Turn the channel!"
"My intent was NOT to call out Eve Lazada at all. Don't know her. All we can go by is what we see on TV."
"And based on THAT......I stand by what I said. Every word of it!"
"Those words never came out of my mouth, <at>MOTCMRWILSON. I would never say that about another man's woman. Don't attach those words to me."
"For those of you who didn't catch the show today -- or just want the podcast -- here ya go: <url>"

"Sorry you guys missed me on 1st Take today. I'm hosting Golf Outing in Upstate, NY for ESPN Radio in New York (98.7FM)."
"<at>IronmanMastin I agree, but you're still exaggerating. We debate 13-to-15 topics a day. 2 on Tebow doesn't define the show. Relax!"

"Glad y'all are showing me love for that last segment on 1st Take today. Loved doing it. Loved talking of my man,Poolie."

"Hmmmmmm!!!!! We'll see :-)"
"Man, you need to stop, <at>wllwdavis2. That's a great show. Plus, don't add more work to my schedule please. Don't give'em any ideas."
"I'm tired of <at>RealSkipBayless already. And the damn show hasn't even started yet. From NFL to NBA to Tebow, he just won't stop. Lawdy!"
"FIRST <url>ing right at ya at the top of the hour. If nothing else, we're as real as it gets."
"You need to thank me, <at>jmccallahan. We'd debate Tebow for an hour a day, instead of a segment, if it were not for me :-)"
"Special s/o to Steelers' LaMarr Woodley. Don(ed $60K to pay fees for EVERY Saginaw (Mich.) Public Schools Student-Athlete. WONDERFUL GESTURE"

"<at>Excali12 Hhhaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!! That's the most hilarious tweet I received all month. Good one, my man!"
"Just some thoughts on the NFL today: RGIII and Luck both looked good enough. T.O. Got a little loose this weekend. So did Eli Manning. But.."
"The Giants still lost. Chi gives me reason to think they'll have a say in the NFC. But the more I think of it, the 49ers should be favorites"
"Man, I can't wait for the NFL season to begin. As for college FB, <url>es down to USC and Alabama for me. LSU and Okla could make noise but"
"It's all about the Tide, their running game with that off. Line, vs. Barkley with Woods and Lee at wideouts for the Nat'l Title. That's the"
"Game I absolutely want to see. Unless, of course, Bama falls to Arkansas, LSU or South Carolina. Then all bets are off."

"<at>ChadedUp <url>munications!"
"<at>WillieWayne06 I try!"
"Folks need to calm down. On FIRST TAKE, race isn't being mentioned as if it's a problem. It's mentioned to articulate different perspectives"
"Ppl need to grow up and stop acting as if just the mere mention of race means someone has done something wrong. It doesn't. Grow up!"
"Dez Bryant is young. He's made mistakes. Jerry Jones is trying to protect his investment, and that's the way it goes."
"If Dez hadn't messed up, he wouldn't be in this situation. It's not a race issue, but that doesn't mean racial dynamics aren't involved."

"Educate <at>RealSkipBayless, <at>omarepps. Educate this man!"
"For those who have been running their mouths about my latest column, <url> how about reading it before opening your mouths."
"<at>Dominicks_ So what does that make your ignorant <at>$#* for wasting your time to tell me that?"
"<at>shyholder A 16-Yr-old assumed to be over age is entirely different than CHILD MOLESTATION. No absolution either way, but it is different."
"<at>KeithK70 Oh Shut up! I'm not a cheerleader. It's your job to wear Pom Poms. It's my job to report on it. You don't like it? Tough!"

"<at>MrDOMO919 And yet you still wish you looked this good (haaa)."
"<at>matt__harris Bye!"
"<at>kriscassbe1 Itunes!"
"Just finished watching the RNC. Not here to get political, but Clint Eastwood (82 yrs old) should not have been out there. Who decided that?"
"And I'm being kind."
"Romney's speech was decent, though. Now let's see what the DNC has in store. I'm interested in truth/facts ppl. Emotions don't tell me much."
"Agree totally with <at>mcuban. One Registered Independent to another!"
"Amen <at>BrandonTierney."
"Man, <at>RealSkipBayless is really buggin' today. And it's not about Tebow. Just EVERYTHING else. FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 <url>ing...RIGHT NOW!!!"

"Come enjoy the show with me and my boy <at>RyanRuocco on ESPN New York (98.7FM). We're having a ball. Call in 800.918.3776."
"Just finished watching some of the DNC. Newark Mayor Corey Booker gave a fantastic speech. Expect the same from Michelle Obama. And we all"
"Know President Obama is going to turn it out on Thursday night. I expect Clinton to do well, too. But it's all about the debates to me."
"I'm interested in facts, ideas and the future. Speeches are great, inspiring. But we issues will determine my vote, not emotion."
"I'm gonna say this right now: Pres. Obama is someplace with tears in his eyes right now -- CRYING over that SENSATIONAL speech by his wife."
"Michelle Obama worked it. Right down to the core of his words, the tears in her eyes. The passion oozing from her breath. SENSATIONAL SPEECH"
"The kind of speech that would shake any man to his core, knowing he has a woman by his side that supportive. What a fantastic FIRST LADY."
"I still want issues, though. Love the speeches. Appreciate them. But that won't determine my vote. REGISTERED INDEPENDENT!"
"<at>Autumnpoet Yes Maam!"
"For those who missed today's edition of FIRST TAKE, HERE YA GO: <url>"
"I'm do ticked off this morning. Bad enough the Giants lost. Now I have to listen to <at>RealSkipBayless, too. Damn! FIRST TAKE. Top of the hour"
"Yeah, <at>RealSkipBayless got on my last nerve today with all his fawning over the Cowboys, but they were the better team. Can't wait 4 Sunday."
"We'll see with the Jets will do vs. The Bills. What the Steelers will do in Denver. What Green does vs. Baltimore, what RGIII does vs Saints"
"For right now, however, I'm disgusted with the Giants. The way the Cowboys look, if the Eagles are close, then the Giants may miss playoffs."

"However, <at>Ike_SwagginU that had you put as much effort and hostility in not making Tebow look like Joe Montana, you wouldn't have to deal w/"

"Don't love is an otherwise quality CB ending his season with one of the most HORRIFIC performances I've ever seen from a CB in NFL HISTORY."

"Like that again, YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT IT. On TV. On Radio. In Print. In the Locker room. In your home. In the streets. EVERYWHERE."
"That's just the way it's going to be. All you have to do to prevent it is BALL.......like most of your teammates were, and usually, do."
"Respectfully, STEPHEN A!"
"Good luck this weekend. And especially the next........once you may possibly face Tebow again."
"Sitting her chillin at the Jets' Game. Don't know if NY is this good or Fitzpatrick/Bills are this bad, but Sanchez looks good throwing ball"
"Tebow won't be needed much if Sanchez keeps throwing the ball this way :-)"
"Game over. Kerley returns punt 60 Yds for TD. Bills <url>ing back from this. Not against this Jets' Defense."
"Oh! Message for <at>RealSkipBayless: Don't think for 1 second you're gonna give credit to Tebow if he accumulates yds in garbage time. No Sir!"
"That hit that just got put on Fred Jackson looks like it may have him out. He got out and walked off. Hard to imagine how he did it. Ugly!"
"<at>Dashiznitz40 Look Damnit! Stop blaming me for that. Do I look like I want to talk about his non-throwing self? Talk to the other dude."
"<at>Schwaggin_ Doesn't count. The Titans don't have an offense."

"<at>Wax_83 Sensational. The kid is a fabulous boxer. But I do believe <url>ing down to 168lbs hurt him. He quit, though. So who cares."
"<at>_Verts I'm still worried. The Bills don't mean anything to me."
"I know Philly won, but can't believe how badly Vick played. Not Good. RGIII was big-time, but we knew the Saints' D wasn't all that. More..."

"<at>MattikenzMurray Bye! I won't miss ya."
"<at>israelibarbie You have a BEAUTIFUL little girl. Tell her Uncle Stephen says ""Thank You So much."""
"Talking to <at>RealSkipBayless about <at>TimTebow is like talking to a brick wall. I'm not heard no matter what I say!"
"<at>MikeZimm24 Why don't you ask Skip."
"Yeah! Yeah!"
"Flacco! Flacco! Flacco! <url>"
"Yeah <at>RealSkipBayless. Whatever! <url>"
"Cedric Benson says:  <url>"
"I'm rooting for GB tonight, but even I can admit that was a bogus unsportsmanlike call. Let'em play. It's Chi vs GB. Stop the softness."

"Damn! Peppers is a BEAST!!!!!!!!!!"
"I'm sitting here and called it: Cutler interception before the half (HAaaaaaa!!!!)"
"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!! <url>"
"<url>eup No!"
"What the hell did I say:  <url>"
"FIRST <url>ing at ya! Told y'all about Cutler (Haaaaa!!!!!!!)"

"Employee in LA. Here's the deal: I've never yelled in a restaurant in my life. Certainly never did this. Never happened. Never would. My Mom"
"Trained me far better than that. It's incredibly sad folks would stoop to such low tactics to try and smear me. Just as bad that DEADSPIN"
"Would allow it. Damn Shame. No matter. I've dealt with worse. At least I can applaud folks for spelling my name correctly. Appreciate that!"
"That's night satirical, <at>caneesq. They're portraying it as if it's true and it's not. Would never do that. It's B.S."
"I don't consider accusation about my behavior in public ""silly"" <at>TheBigTripper. I'm not gonna harp on it. Just setting the record straight."
"Btw......I'm hearing that Floyd Mayweather tweeted me. Can't find it. Can anyone find it for me, please!"
"Would never waste my time, <at>Michael_Necci. Wouldn't even bother."
"<at>Boston_George03 Haaa! I'm over it, Bro! I'm in my 40's."
"Ppl can say what they want, <at>wodnicki. I believe is being cordial and respectful. No one gets to just approach me w/o Hello and ask ???"
"I don't play that, <at>wodnicki. A simple Hello, courtesy, respect before bombarding me with ?? Is proper. Problems occur when I'm approached"
"No, <at>JoshJae. My boycott ONLY  refers to Mayweather or Pacquaio PPV's without them fighting one another. Nothing else. Huge Boxing fan here"
"Watching the fight. Chavez Jr. May be younger, but he looks older. Lost entirely too much weight. Has nothing. Martinez shutting him OUT!"
"Had Chavez winning round 6, then Martinez throws an <url>bination......all connecting! Wow! Even round, though."
"Martinez appears to be the Pernell Whitaker to Chavez Jr. The quick, elusive southpaw that gave Chavez Sr. Fits many years ago. Too much"
"Just embarrassing. Freddie Roach -- Chavez Jr. Trainer -- is saying DURING THE FIGHT his guy can't handle Martinez Speed, calling Martinez"
"The young guy, even though he's 37 years old. Unbelievable."
"OMG! OMG! OMG! Martinez gets dropped twice in the 12th Round. Re-making of his dad vs. Meldrick Taylor. OMG! Unbelievable. Unbelievable!!!!!"
"<at>resnbledoubt Peeps! I specifically said I was banning PPV with Mayweather/Pacquaio -- NOT BOXING ALTOGETHER. Pls quote me accurately!"
"No, <at>AD1216. Chavez Sr. Was legit. But he did lose to Pernell Whitaker. That draw was highway robbery!"
"<at>EdEwade1833 Wasn't calling him out, idiot. Was calling out Chavez Jr. For forcing his trainer to say that. <url>prehend!"
"Sanchez to Santonio Holmes.......caught Ike Taylor looking for help on NY's 3 Tight-End look instead of just defending Holmes. Damn!"
"No Sir, <at>richeisen. Coughlin was doing the Barking. Schiano was just listening, knowing he didn't have a leg to stand on."
"Tell me about it, <at>DwyaneWade."
"Tebow in, but didn't throw the ball. Seems sensible to me. On another note, good defense on Holmes by Ike Taylor. Just being fair here."
"Ain't that something, <at>RyanRuocco"
"I picked Seattle to win this game. America voted against me on Facebook in favor of <at>realskipbayless"
"Good! Same here, <at>RealSkipBayless. Can't wait to talk about your Cowboys, period!"
"Oh Damn!!! <at>RealSkipBayless is on the prowl. Heated. Hot and roaring. Gonna be a long morning. FIRST TAKE in the house RIGHT NOW on ESPN2."
"<at>J_Rhino1017 Sure! If you're aching to get your butt kicked!"
"<at>SquirtMe6969 who said he was elite? Maybe if you weren't so busy focusing on race you'd actually HEAR what's said."
"I see, <at>jesusjunkey So I guess I look smart then, picking Seattle, Philly, Giants, Pitt, GB, San Diego, Miami, San Fran, etc? Shut ur mouth!"
"<at>nickbowser8 For now (Haa)"
"Absolutely!"
"<at>Str8ToTheFront I ask myself that question every damn day!"
"Ok, this officiating is not funny anymore. It's really bad and the NFL needs to do something about it. Seriously!"
"Amen, <at>RealSkipBayless. Isn't that enough? How can it be good to be slow, somewhat inefficient and lacking control!"
"I hear you, <at>ampwigg. But you can't moan about an unfair process you were never a part of. Gotta speak up for yourself!"
"<at>LennonEmpire Thanks Bro!"
"<at>AbtoHassan Yes Siiiirrrrrrr!!!!!!!!"
"Just in case anyone was wondering what I feel about the Jets' performance on Sunday, here ya go: <url>"
"Just saw your little skit on me <at>JimmyFallon. Loved it! Hilarious! Except the only time <at>Timtebow gets roses from me is once he's a fullback"
"<at>mdlechildjeremy I try to be."
"<at>CjGreene1 stop it!!!"
"<at>DerrickJaxn I can live with that!"
"<at>yspivak Saw it. Loved it."

"<at>LuckieOwen Damn good kid. Parents did a helluva job."
"<at>Megan_Broadway We'd lose to you :-)"
"So do most, <at>ZiceyBraumseil. Folks just busy hating to admit it."
"FIRST TAKE'S IN THE HOUSE right now!!! Holla at ya boys!!!"
"<at>JonnyNeo1 You must be one too since you're so knowledable about it!"
"Your ire is misguided, <at>_BreakinAnkles. <at>Ochocinco is embarrassing himself by flip-flopping and not defending himself to some degree."
"What has <at>ochocinco ever done, <at>_BreakinAnkles? It's too much watching this dude do this to himself. If he's wrong, settle it privately."
"Apologize and move on, <at>_BreakinAnkles. But <at>ochocinco shouldn't be doing all of this. Sorry! Can't take watching it."
"I'm about to interview Manny Pacquaio RIGHT NOW on ESPN New York (98.7FM). Spoke to him earlier on TV. This will be just as intense."
"Absolutely, <at>ExNiceGuyNowLOL. I believe in <at>FloydMayweather. But I'm tired of seeing him and Pacman fight everyone else. Boxing needs this!"
"<at>lookitsvikvik Then don't watch because I'm not changing."
"For those who missed today's FIRST TAKE, especially the part with us and Pacquaio and Marquez, here ya go: <url> Worth look!"
"Haaaa! No worries."
"<at>SamyEastmall a little bit. But he's just not that relevant to me anymore."
"<at>jDedering Moss in his Prime. But Megatron's a stud!"
"<at>Ron_Burgundy94 a dream earned through years of hard work to get to this point."
"Giants/Panthers...... <url>"
"More on Giants.... <url>"
"Damn! I'm wrong already. Looking bad picking against the Giants. Both <at>RealSkipBayless and <at>RyanRuocco are looking like prophets right now."
"Damn!"
"<at>chidichidibang Where were you last week when I pick all three games better than him? In your diapers?"
"More Giants..... <url>"
"I'm a big dummy: <url>"
"That's RIGHT!!!!! The man! Derek JETERRRRRRRRRRR!!!"
"I don't know about anyone else, but I'm barely interested in Mich/ND. This Fla. State/Clemson game is the joint. Robinson has been awful BTW"
"<at>Real_TonyG Nope!"
"Watkins throw under that wildcat formation looked better than anything Tebow's thrown (Haaaaa)"
"Clicked back over to Michigan/ND just in time to see ANOTHER TURNOVER by Denard Robinson. Damn!"
"Just like I told y'all, Jets offense is not good. The vacillate b/t Sanchez not throwing the ball well and receivers (Hill) dropping passes."
"They'd just better not lose this week, or they'll be <url>e week 5."
"See, that's exactly the damn kind of pass that will get Sanchez benched."
"Tebow runs wrong route. Ball hits him upside his helmet/head. Lawd have mercy!"
"Even I can tell that <at>Timtebow should've been used in that last red zone sequence."
"Hard to believe, but if the Jets lose you've gotta look at Cromartie a little bit. That was one helluva move put on him by Hartline!"
"Yes <at>RealSkipBayless. Dallas just survived. What else is new."
"We already know how it's gonna work out, <at>itsgabrielleu. It's the Dolphins."
"Congrats to the lucky you-know-what Jets. Carpenter helped them BIGTIME."
"Totally agree with you, <at>RyanRuocco. He's about the only dude who did so offensively for the Jets!"
"Un-freakin-believable. Vick gets popped on 3rd and goal, fumbles and has it returned 98 yds for a TD. Arizona 24-0. Eagles look AWFUL."
"Don't want this to happen, but this is what will lead to the end of Andy Reid and Vick. Vick taking too many hits. No protection. But he"
"Can't drop back to pass like he has all day, holding onto football. Shameful performance."
"<at>aaburns55 Evidently, you do all the time!"
"Before anyone even asks, I had no problem with Jay Pharoah's impersonation of me on SNL. I think he's hysterical. All love!!!"
"Bigtime call by Tomlin to go for it on 4th down. But Steelers need to close the deal. This game should not have been close."
"FIRST TAKE is about <url>e at you. Vick/Eagles, Manning/Broncos, Pat, Texans, Jets/Revis, Cowboys, Officials and more. ESPN2 at top of hour"
"<at>Riedski Haaaaaa!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>jmccallahan We went 2 days last week without mentioning Tebow once. I'm working with <at>RealSkipBayless. That's a bigtime improvement."
"Look at who's on my radio show with <at>RyanRuocco right now: <at>RealSkipBayless. Lawd! What is this <url>ing to."
"<at>Kfernandez8 just for the same reason you're punk, sorry self is finding the reason to spew profanity at me now."
"He'll turn them around for you, <at>itsgabrielleu. There isn't a greater motivational leader in Sports History than Ray Lewis. I'm serious."
"Watching this Green Bay/Seattle Game. I know Seahawks are tough but this might be the most ATROCIOUS performance by an off. Line I've seen."
"Don't tell me there's an excuse for ANY TEAM surrendering 7 Sacks in a half.....especially if it's GB and you're suppose to protect Rodgers."
"I'm sorry......that's 8 Sacks now. This one was on Rodgers, though. He should've thrown it away. This is unbelievable."
"Man, <at>ItotheAN, you have no idea how badly I wish that would happen. I'd love to be next Howard Cosell. But America won't allow it. Oh Well!"
"Will someone put an end to these substitute referees. What a horrible, horrible roughing the passer call vs GB to continue that Sea Drive."
"Plus, there's been 4-consecutive calls. This is so bad, it can't be put into words. Just <url>plete unmitigated disaster. Just horrible."
"That's it! I'm done. CLEARLY AN INTERCEPTION. The NFL should be ashamed of itself for allowing this officiating to regress to this point."
"JUST DISGRACEFUL! ABSOLUTE ROBBERY IN THE NFL. The league has thrown away it's integrity. That can't say anything to the players anymore."
"Golden Tate with a Blatant pass interference on Sam Shields. Then Jennings had the ball, brings it to his chest. All Tate has on ball is arm"
"Horrible! Just Horrible.If I'm the Packers, I would refuse to go back out on the field to be there for the xtra pt. I just wouldn't do it."
"If the NFL wants to maintain any credibility whatsoever, it should OVERTURN this decision IMMEDIATELY. This game should be awarded to GB."
"I CAN'T WAIT for FIRST TAKE this morning. What I saw was a damn DISGRACE. That's all I have to say . See y'all on ESPN2 at top of the hour."
"For those who didn't see FIRST TAKE today, here ya go: <url> That is.....when you finish listening to me and <at>RyanRuocco on"

"Are the Giants who we think they are? <url>"
"Let Dino Costa say whatever he wants about me, <at>unstableMIC. I respect the hell out of that man as a Radio Host. All he had to do was call."
"I never once called anyone racist, <at>LanhamTroy. I said I was <url>fortable and I stand by it. That's how I felt. Was just being honest."
"Once again, <at>DinoCosta is entitled to his opinion. I'm entitled to mine. I respect the hell out of that man's ability as a Radio Host."
"I take absolutely no offense to what ppl are saying <at>DinoCosta said about me. He's earned the right to have his opinion. #Respect#"
"Nah, <at>leninRodrguez. He's a damn good radio host. I don't have to agree with him to respect him. I play on MY level. Won't sink to another's"
"<at>Acnetame Absolutely correct!"
"<at>JagBull1 With D-Rose injury? Pul-leeze."
"I have no idea what he said, <at>BjAnacker. I just heard he was critical."
"<at>SIlverRazar I stand up every day bro. I have 20 years of proof. You want <url>e w/ an insult, you need <url>e better than that,"
"<at>ITZ_M3_Y0 he's entitled to his opinion. That's a fact. He damn sure didn't change mine."
"<at>BjAnacker Thanks my man."
"<at>All4kash Thanks Bro!"
"<at>macmason09 I respect his abilities as a radio host. Hatin' on me doesn't change that. Doesn't change my position on any matter, either."
"<at>magicmeech9 Thank you for listening enough to notice!"
"<at>DMVballer9 With big-time <url>es big-time responsibility. The smart one is one who's humble enough not to abuse it."
"<at>SkinnydaBarber1 Thank You!"
"Btw......I just read what Whitlock had to say about <url>ments in his column on Cam Newton. I had no problem with it whatsoever. No biggie."
"He hasn't changed my position one bit either. I know what I said, what I meant and how I feel. I stand by every damn word I said on 1st TAKE"
"Yo! Yo! Gotta give my man, <at>ProducerAmadeus some love. He's the one who produced <at>ESPN_FirstTake new theme song w/ Wale. #Much Respect!"
"Another thing: can't begin to put into words how hyped I am about this <url>ing NBA season. It's apropo than the Heat's media day was today."
"Miami is the obvious favorites. As far am I'm concerned, only LA and OKC has a shot to knock'em off. And the days of criticizing one Mr."
"One Mr. <at>KingJames <url>e to an end. He answered the bell. Definitely has shut me up. I'm giving the man his props. Now it's all about"
"HOW MANY? There's nothing else to say about <at>KingJames or <at>DwyaneWade. Will it be 2,3 or 4. That's the question. But the days of questioning"
"What LeBron is made of are over. I personally have nothing else to say. <at>RealSkipBayless is an entirely different matter, of course."
"Yes! I heard what Mr. Graca said about me, <url>pletely uncalled for, the personal stuff. But that's the way it goes. So be it!"
"This is unbelievable. The 49ers are running <at>TimTebow plays better than the Jets do for Tebow. Lawd have mercy."
"Glad you know it <at>RyanRuocco. Haaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Can't believe I'm about to say this, bit it may be time for <at>TimTebow. Sanchez looks awful right now. Fans are booing. Might as well!"
"This is how embarrassing things are: MetLife stadium is still loud...b/c 49ER fans Are all over the place. The Jets are atrocious. Horrible."
"And there's no reprieve in-sight. Revis out! Holmes out! Sanchez looks awful and even Tebow looks like he can't run. Pathetic!"
"This is what happens when you neglect your offense and try to fool folks into believing <at>TimTebow and Tony Sparano are saviors.Sad!"
"Oh Stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless. Don't even try to make this about <at>TimTebow. They collective stink. Nobody's sparking them today."
"I believe Sproles drop will be huge!!!!!!!"
"Actually, because of this holding penalty, dude may miss this FG!"
"FIRST <url>ing at the top of the hour on ESPN2. We'll be touching on a lot of games, but y'all know what <at>RealSkipBayless is hot for!"
"Damn!!!"
"<at>coacheaddy You know it was! 100 pts in 2 Games to AFC-East teams. Enough said!"
"TONY OH-NO!!!! Pathetic! Cowboys are just sorry tonight. Like I keep telling <at>RealSkipBayless, accident waiting to happen."
"JESUS!!!!!!!!!!! Romo has 5 Interceptions. I wonder what <at>RealSkipBayless is gonna say tomorrow!!!!!!!!!"
"My pleasure!"
"Uh oh! <at>RealSkipBayless has got a lot of stuff on his mind. And it's not regarding <at>TimTebow. Kobe, watch out! First <url>ing right now"
"<at>GLstat Go ahead and Hate, my brother. It's what makes the world go round!"
"Sorry, <at>followMyNutz. Then that means you sound like a criminal. I didn't dog that brother. I pointed out a record that spans 8 yrs."
"<at>teeybrown I gave you facts. You're giving me emotion!"
"<at>KELLIANTHONY Amen!"
"<at>joecavan Thank you."
"I gave FACTS, <at>TerribleTerp27. That's all. I said I wish Brandon Marshall well and hope he's sincere, but we'll see. Nothing wrong with it."
"I have a job to do, <at>SoPlugged. I was asked a question; I answered it. You want lies? A phony? Turn the channel. I speak truth to power!"
"<at>TREEFARMS Thank you!"
"Absolutely not, <at>therealJgoss. Totally was NOT talking about Iverson. If anything, he's the one who refused to do that!"
"<at>Random_Topher No you don't! :-)"
"<at>DocksNdaBuildn Amen!"
"False! <at>Roll_1_Smoke_1"
"No true, <at>Prioritymc. I was asked a question, looked up the facts and gave my answer. You don't watch to ask me to lie. Fair. Impartial."
"For those who didn't see today's FIRST TAKE - or still wondering what I said about Brandon Marshall -- here ya go:"

"<at>LiLLiLWhite Nope. They don't."
"No Sir!"
"Huh? <at>mcuban"
"<at>BjMurph33 You have no idea how much I'd love to do that. Me? A moderator? Love it."
"<at>DLittleAlmighty Yes Sir."
"What is Mike Tannenbaum doing: <url> I certainly don't know."
"Wow, <at>FontaneJackson. He's beating up on who??? I'm so impressed. SHAAA-LOOOP!!!"
"I'll make sure I'm man enough by not wasting my time acknowledging you after this tweet, <at>lmautism. That should work for you."
"That -- RIGHT THERE -- is why CC Sabathia is Big-Time. Surrender's 8th inn double with No Outs, then shuts down the side. BIG-TIME!"
"YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! Russell Martin in the house. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"I don't care what mode <at>realskipbayless is in. I'm wondering if he even knows what he's watching."
"I like what I'm seeing from the Heat in regards to them moving the B-Ball. But I'm LOVING the way Boston is moving the ball."
"This game is going to the wire. And it's a bad sign for the Heat because they're play crisp...and STILL Boston won't go away."

"I mean, What The Hell??? Haven't Eagles' fans been asking them to do this all season long."
"So much for all that talk about the Nick Foles starting in place of Vick. What a disaster."
"Btw......can we officially close this book of a season on the NY Jets? Their defense scored their ONLY point. Their offense did squat. Sad!"
"For those who did not see FIRST TAKE today, check it out: <url>"
"Why bother asking?"

"<at>AudiAndrew10 Ummm, do I look like Rob Parker? Get your eyes checked."
"<at>TheonlyYoungE Thank You!"
"<at>AirForceLiggs No sir! You heard me say eventually they would be if Amar'e doesn't return, along with Shumpert. Get it right!"
"For those who didn't see my column on D'Antoni and the Lakers, here ya go: <url>"
"About <url>e on Sportscenter in 5 minutes. Live from LA."
"On another note, very sad day in the B-Ball world. We lost a special man in Kenny ""Eggman"" Williamson, who lost his battle w/ Cancer."
"Dear, dear friend of Williamson put it best: He wasn't a luminary, but he was BASKETBALL ROYALTY. Wonderful to everyone who knew him. Shame!"
"#NBAGAMETIME Blatche had a nice move there. Hopefully, it'll continue. <url>es the play and the Nets are significantly better. We'll see."
"#NBAGAMETIME Melo is still flowing. Forget his pts. He's shooting 8-for-14 from the field. This is the kind of efficiency we need from him."
"#NBAGAMETIME For the record, I'm in LA, about to witness the Lakers -- pre D'Antoni. Hopefully, tonight's not last time I see them play ""D"""
"#NBAGAMETIME Btw....Felton's 15 points are nice, but I want to see more than 2 assists. Who the hell does he think he is? Jeremy Lin (haaa)"
"#NBAGAMETIME And I'm not happy at all that NY is tied with Orlando. They should be running over this team. But I'll be patient."
"Actually, I don't!"
"#NBAGAMETIME See, here's my thing on JR: I know he's lethal. Problem? Sometimes it's against the opponent. Other times it's against own team"
"We can definitely meet up before I leave on Friday, Jake."
"Do you have any idea who you're talking about, <at>georgemallet? MonteRoss is my college teammate and one of my best friends in the world."
"<at>CheyenneTweets Save your emotions for your spouse/partner. I call things like I see them. If I believed in the Knicks, I would say so."
"<at>AA15rifle Get over it. The man can't throw. Only said it a million times. But to do him like that anonymously, that's low-class. Too much."
"Who gives a damn, <at>Raidermike63. The man can't throw. But he doesn't deserve the weak, pathetic Jets talking about him like that. Wrong!"
"Thank you, <at>SturdyShow. That is PRECISELY what I'm saying."
"<at>Malachi_Light The Jaguars swear they didn't want him. Only that their new owner asked them to consider it, but it was the coaches choice."
"<at>Bre_Rice <at>RealSkipBayless They deserve it."

"<at>cyoungconsults Because that's not how it went down!"
"I'm here at the Clips/Heat Game. Let me tell y'all something: <at>KingJames is using post moves on Blake Griffin. EFFECTIVELY. That is trouble."
"By that I mean..if <at>KingJames gets to a pt where his post game is like THAT, it's over for the entire NBA. And I do mean over!"
"Also....Jamal Crawford just boogied on Ray Allen. 7-quick points off the bench. Instant offense. If on, he's a difference maker."
"Buckle up! FIRST TAKE <url>ing at you on ESPN2 right now. Yes, we'll touch on Tebow, but stay w/ me. Certain things need to be said.Finally"
"With profound respect, <at>pr3achpreacha, I believe that it totally untrue. What ppl say is that he can't throw. He's given chances bestowed"
"upon no one else, <at>pr3achpreacha. That is just a fact. One can love the lord and appreciate who <at>TimTebow is and still say that. Sorry!"

"#NBAGAMETIME Yeah, Yeah, Felton. Way to ball, baby. Very proud of my Knicks right now."
"#NBAGAMETIME And I don't know about anybody else, but I love the fact that Melo has just 9 pts thus far and the Knicks are still in this."
"#NBAGAMETIME Yeahhhhhh J.R. Yeaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!"
"#NBAGAMETIME Keep D-ing up Knicks. Keep D-ing up."
"#NBAGAMETIME Haaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Kidd still has it in  him. Go NY, Go NY, Goooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"#NBAGAMETIME Big-time win by the Knicks. I'm impressed. Good night for Knicks' fans."
"BUCKLE UP! It's time for FIRST TAKE on ESPN2. We'll be talking basketball and football. Hopefully, no Tebow :-)"

"Yours Truly with <url>ing right now on ESPN Radio New York (98.7FM). Holla at ya boys!"

"Haaaaa!!!!!"
"<at>Aill_617 My man, I only care about what WOMEN have to say about my looks!"
"<at>Switchin_Laness Get the wax out of your ears, or get glasses to read correctly. That's exactly what I've been saying."
"<at>mattvazin You got that right!"
"<at>diceman4192 Legit contenders. I'm dead serious about that."
"<at>Sosa_RFBPReZ Because the Nets are not my priority. The Knicks are."
"<at>Knight_Time00 Haaaaa! Did you call ME a virgin? Now that's a first. There's hope for me afterall."
"<at>RyanRuocco I think the Nets are gonna get crushed!"
"<at>COOL_C81 How am I jumping off the bandwagon just because I picked them to lose tonight? Who the hell ever said they're going 82-0? Idiot!"
"Like I told y'all, Melo will be an MVP Candidate for the Knicks. If they continue to win. The dude is unstoppable when he's on."
"But the Knicks still need more. Very happy with their record, but perspective is needed. Big-time wins over Mia and SA, but look at big pic:"
"Impressive. Rooting for them. Not trying to rain on parade. God Knows NY has waited long enough. But everything's falling their way for now."
"Let's keep our eyes out for what ensues. Time will tell. And so will <url>petition."
"I know one thing: Orlando looks straight stupid for not working out a deal for Brook Lopez. He's not D-Howard but the man can play off."
"<at>ESPN_FirstTake Stop trippin. Kobe did that to Phil. Relax."
"Very impressed with the Nets right now. Hope it lasts."
"FIRST TAKE is in the house. ESPN2. Right now."
"Yes Sir. Martin! My all-time favorite."
"Sure, <at>coledaddy_22. Just go to school, get ur education and spend 20 yrs establishing your credentials in this biz, and we'll have ya on."
"<at>Pollydore23 Thank you so much!"
"<at>Stoney_Grant12 Look at FIRST TAKE. Don't ask me to repeat myself."
"What a game b/t Clips/Thunder. Westbrook big-time with 2 J's, but decision-making still questionable. CP3 just off 2nite. D'Jordan big-time"
"Post move. Matt Barnes showed up, too. But Durant is the man. Still needs to be more aggressive."
"Here's the thing: Del Negro has got to get something going other than Pick-and-Roll. Just has to be more versatile as a coach. It's in him."
"Bogus foul call on CP3 on Durant. Let'em play."
"And btw.....Hubie Brown is absolutely right: Blake Griffin is not only NOT scoring. He can't even get touches. OKC is D'ing up."
"<at>44TheLegend Cats like you ain't in the league anymore, bro! ""Tuff"" has a new definition now that you, Oak, Mahorn and crew are gone :-)"
"I think the Knicks are <url>e back at win this. Mavs 3-straight blunders: giving up 3, 3-pt play <url>miting reach-in foul after miss."
"Let's Go Knicks!!!!"
"Haaaa!!! Kaman just missed open layup"
"Bull<at>#*+<at>! Melo got mugged on that shot. No Call by refs. But Collison missed. Now Melo's gonna pay them back with a game-winner. Watch!"
"Damn! Mad props to the Matrix, Shawn Marion, on defense. Made Melo missed, plus Melo fouls out on miss. Damn! Damn! Damn!"
"I'll be on Sportscenter at the top of the hour...discussing the coach from Morehead State. You've seen the video? You know <url>ing!"
"But don't miss <at>RealSkipBayless and myself on 1st Take this morning. 10AM, Eastern Time on ESPN2. We'll really get into it then. But nicely!"
"Happy Thanksgiving everyone. FIRST TAKE still in the house on ESPN2. RRIIIGGGGHHHTTTTT NOW!"
"I'm so Thankful for my Mom's Health, along with the tremendous love I receive from family and friends. Wishing all of you a Happy One Today."
"I'm done with Schaub. I've believed in him enough. Totally done with him."
"See, here's what is gonna tick me off: These Redskins'  receivers dropping passes."
"I tried to tell y'all about them Cowboys. What a waste. Get Garrett out of there. At least you'll know you're moving in a right direction."
"I knew the Jets would get blown out....EVENTUALLY. What I never imagined is that they've be this God-Awful. What a freakin' disgrace!"
"I knew the Jets would get blown out, but not like this. This is <url>plete annihilation. Warranting change. Season is over. Thank God!"
"<at>thefishuation Are you even out of diapers yet. Shallop!"
"<at>ShutUpEmilio Then I suspect you know enough to know that the Lakers are not your typical Lakers."
"<at>RyJ613 And that's why the Rockets aren't that good. Because they have fans like you who are too soft."
"<at>OldMetJohn I'm actually very happy. Perhaps YOU'RE the one who's angry because you don't want me to be Happy!"
"<at>shortyblack509 36 Years and counting!"

"<at>wilkensjeune Stay disappointed. Anybody who thinks Woods' action was NOT inappropriate is playing Race Card. He was out of control. Period."
"<at>KimberleyLocke That's the way to go, Girl. Dexter S6 is real good, so far. Love that show."
"<at>GOOCHAVELI Seasons 3 thru 5."
"<at>wilkensjeune Pay attention the times. Wake up. Your emotions won't <url>plish a damn thing!"
"I simply cannot believe that the Knicks picked the night they're facing Jeremy Lin to stink up the joint. I'm so ashamed of them right now!"
"<at>TheReal_DJM Yes it is!"
"<at>QNC2 Huh? What did SNL do now???"
"<at>SkipHater1 Actually, I was 3-for-3 on Thanksgiving Day ole' Ignorant one!"

"Thanks Magic man, <at>MagicJohnson. Always appreciate the love!"
"Right now, I'm loving what I'm seeing from Crean's boys at Indiana. They're blowing UNC out of the building. <at>DwyaneWade must be excited."
"<at>30bjones He did. But Crean was his coach there before leaving for Indiana."
"People, <at>DwyaneWade would be happy because Crean is his former coach at Marquette. I really wonder about some of you folks sometimes!"
"FIRST TAKE in the house on ESPN2 until 12 Noon (EST). Tune in. Lots of interesting <url>ing up!"
"<at>mauricefieldman You're ignorance is shining thru. Strictly because you assume I'm rich, which is totally false. And to call out Bill Cosby?"
"<at>mauricefieldman You have no idea how ignorant you sound. Your not liking something he says doesn't negate the MILLIONS he's poured into our"
"<url>munity. You should be ashamed of yourself for evening thinking to speak of Bill Cosby negatively."
"<at>LucaBrasi718 Thank You!"
"<at>xMouthpiece23 Not hating. Just stating facts!"

"Folks, y'all are more than <url>ed to call into my Radio show with <at>RyanRuocco on ESPN NY (98.7FM). 8000.919.3776 is the call-in #."
"I'm here. Nobody's running!"
"<at>joeyheinrich Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!"
"After the Tide Rolled -- as I said they would -- I decided to watch B'Klyn vs. Miami. Y'all need to watch these Nets. Good decision-making."
"The Nets are moving the ball well, Hitting perimeter shots, being unselfish. And they haven't even learned to play together yet. Look out NY"
"<at>VisionDriver You'll see me on Monday. I'll deal with him then!"
"I'll tell ya something else: <at>DwyaneWade is looking special right now. Nets can't post or create anything in penetration. Off has shut down."
"After shooting 50 percent or better in each of first 3 qt's, B'klyn shot 14 percent in the 4th QT. Disgraceful. J. Johnson has to help out."
"He's too good to be playing the way he's playing. Deron Williams needs his help. Other dudes are limited. Not those 2. JJ has to do better."
"<at>AM3RICANCentaur Thank you for the inspiration. Btw....you have GREAT taste!"

"Never once did I pretend I was here to make <url>fortable, <at>flawlesstracks. I have the platform to speak truth as I see it. Done!"

"Damn lie, <at>TreyGrundy. Facts always <url>pany my words. You just late the hate block your hearing!"
"<at>Kuntry_OFDACREW I respond to everyone I can. If I totally ignored ignorance, I'd barely have folks to talk to."

"<at>MarcFusciello Goodbye!"
"Melo couldn't catch the ball too well. It's looking like he's not going to play vs. Heat tonight, so says Knicks. Hope that's not true!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, Raymond Felton is putting on a show. I can't believe what I'm seeing from the Knicks right now. Hope it lasts!"
"Spoelstra went with M. Miller and R. Allen in and it didn't work. Then he inserted Norris Cole. Got quickness in an off and def. Difference!"
"Knicks are not getting open shots now. Mia has amped up defensive pressure. Now Knicks are trying to go 1-on-1. Won't work. Kidd and Felton"
"Need to save day. They'll need to get the ball moving again. Knicks had an 18-pt lead. Even w/o Melo, we're about to find out a little about"
"Them."
"I honestly cannot believe my eyes. The Knicks have BLOWN OUT the Heat. It's 3:47 left and the building is clearing. I have been awakened."

"But what you need to understand <at>roddywhiteTV is that y'all always do damage during regular season -- then tank it during the playoffs."
"You're a bad boy, <at>roddywhiteTV. Can't deny it. Y'all PUNKED the Giants today. Can't deny it. Y'all are NO JOKE. Mad respect to you. But...."

"Whether Te'o was duped or not is irrelevant to me. The question is: did the kid dupe then nation is saying the things he said about her?"
"He claimed they were soulmates once they connected eye-to-eye, implying the actually met one another. He spoke glowingly of a love affair"

"She got into a car accident; he never went to see her. She was diagnosed with Leukemia; he never went to see her. She obviously received"

"......Despite the fact that he's a student-athlete, with classes and football practice and supposedly in no position to afford such bills."
"So, in the end, it doesn't matter who concocted the scheme or when. All that matters is that Te'o ultimately told knew and conveyed PUBLICLY"
"What he conveyed. It's JUST MY OPINION, but I don't see how he was totally hoodwinked over the course of 3 years. Not buying it!"
"<at>colbygibbs47 haaaaaaaaa!!!!!!"
"I don't give a damn about his personal life, <at>KalaBabu08. I care about addressing news, which is what he made himself into. Deal with it!"

"FIRST TAKE in the house. And so am I. Skip's about to trip off <at>KingJames again. But not just him!!!!!"
"I said what I said and I meant what I meant. Regarding our President, I was talking about his intelligence and <url>plishments in life - NOT"
"His politics or policies. I respect THE PRESIDENT of our country -- no matter who he is. And as for Rodman, it was an ignorant display."
"Plain and simple. Watch the damn interview. And for those questioning my BLACKNESS, let me be clear: KICK ROCKS! Especially to those who"
"Wouldn't take a stance on any damn thing if it cost them $5 out of their pocket. Get some guts -- and heart -- <url>e talk to me!"

"Of course Wale agrees with me, <at>RealFreddyO. What's the matter with you?"
"Not the least bit interested, <at>maggiepie87. If I watch anyone, it'll be the Rangers. And only because I'd HAVE TO."
"Not at all, <at>TheRealJihad. I'm saying point the finger where it belongs!"
"Afternoon edition of FIRST TAKE ON ESPN -- not ESPN2 -- <url>ing your way right now. Holla at ya Boys!!!!!"

"<at>Primetime000 I did. But I don't care b/c I'm not the one questioning his skills."
"<at>LightSkinned_x3 Nope!"
"<at>hashbrown317 We discussed it all. Pay attention to content, not the headline, and you would've noticed!"

"<at>alexgalvan33 Thanks Alex!"
"<at>LareJoe Jennings is gone!"
"<at>ArtsnFarts23 We're all entitled to our feelings!"

"Amen, <at>_KPOWERS. Amen Brother!"
"Did you forget who Babe Ruth played against, <at>mattfishsr? Or should I say....DIDN'T play against?"
"<at>bbar3bati I'd feel very sorry for you if you did!"
"I'm about to address this Sherman thing with <at>RealSkipBayless on FIRST TAKE yesterday afternoon RIGHT NOW!!! On Radio (ESPN-NY 98.7FM)."
"Time constraints, and Skip wanted to defend himself, <at>bc4_bc."
"<at>edlover1911 No doubt. Roo!"
"<at>JLS89 you can say that, Jeremy. No problem. Our colleagues shouldn't."
"<at>DODSgtMaJ no need. I'm a believer."
"<at>shutmouths The RATINGS say otherwise my man :-). Sorry to deliver the bad news!"
"<at>_Fear_No_Man_ I believe I've said from Day 1 that the Lakers would make the playoffs......then lose in the 1st Round. What's the problem?"
"I don't have a problem with it, <at>BM2013BM. If I'm wrong, it should be pointed out that I'm <url>es with the job. Bib Boy rules."
"And Btw...although the Celts <url>pletely exceeded my expectations, <url>ments pertained to <url>peting for the title. Not Reg season"
"I said what I believed, <at>theflea4L. No regrets. You want someone lying to you about what's in their heart, go watch someone else!"
"Dwight Howard looks strong today, <at>cap801. The healthier he gets, the more potent he'll be."

"<at>Josh_Tansey 20 years of credentials. Look it up then call me. I'm not running.....from ANYBODY in this business."
"It's true...as much as i hate to admit it. Understand, if Tiago Splitter balls, TD has help on the frontline. Makes the Spurs lethal!"
"<at>PeteJack85 Haaa. Thanks!"
"Okay, it's time. Yours truly with <at>RealMichaelKay, <at>RyanRuocco and my man <at>DonLagreca -- the 4 Horseman -- live on ESPN Radio (98.7FM) NY."

"<at>kaytwo_ Thanks!"
"<at>mattdeedub Phenonmenal Coach and man. Will be greatly missed!"
"<at>JonnySoul90210 Huh?"
"<at>HughesFTW Nope! To me, any game that goes to overtime with no definitive loser is a tie. So what do I know :-)"
"I don't usually get on Kids, but Richmond's Williams foul vs. Clayton was just idiotic. Not smart at all. Ultimately gave Charlotte the game"
"FIRST TAKE in the house at the top of the hour on ESPN2. <at>RealSkipBayless has a huge attitude today. Don't know why. Uh Oh! (Smile!!!!!)"
"Nobody, <at>MeadMulvihill, said he doesn't deserve to be picked High. The debate is should he be No.1-overall. Stop acting like we killed him!"
"<at>MrCJames308 Not better than Duncan. Stop it!"
"<at>therealBriBoW Okay!"

"Ladies and Gentlemen, Jeff Green is putting on a show. This moment is what Ainge and Doc acquired him from OKC for. #Unbelievablethusfar"
"That should not have been a technical foul on LeBron. But give Celtics credit: Showing a whole lot of heart. Enough to make you believe:"
"If they had everyone healthy, the East wouldn't be as locked up as most of us think it would be."
"Then again, it's only the first half. I'm still expecting the Heat <url>e back from this."
"I'm about to make a cameo on FIRST TAKE right now.......for 1 segment!"
"Haaaaa! you could possibly get it. But only if I decided on something Bigger and Better was on the Horizon :-)"
"What the hell is going on? Why is this happening to Miami. I refuse to believe -- even now -- that they'll lose this game."
"Not good if <at>KingJames loses in Cleveland. Even if he's off his game........his teammates need to pick him up."
"We're off until Monday, <at>TheBigLEPOWski"
"<at>DavisonGreg ain't over yet"

"<at>jJandbytheGram not funny!"
"<at>KyleMoule Of Course!"
"Puh-leeze, <at>mattstanley10 Nobody twisted a damn thing about <at>DezBryant. I said he can ball. The Cowboys just stink, that's all. #FalseHype!"
"<at>jKisk34 A lot. He's a great young coach!"
"Pay attention <at>FearTheTurtle24. I'll give any member of the Cowboys are hard time. They stink! Damn shame they're called AMERICA'S TEAM!"
"Bye <at>SportsAce214. We won't miss you!"
"He can say something if he wants to, <at>TomSheldon22. Nobody's running from <at>DezBryant. I didn't diss him any different than any other Cowboy"
"They stink, <at>TomSheldon22. Tell <at>DezBryant to call me when the Cowboys make the playoffs and stop getting spanked by NFC Foes <at> season end"
"Nope, <at>Stringer_B_. Don't care too either. All I know is 2K yards doesn't equal playoffs. He's been home watching -- like me -- last 2 years"
"<at>GaliEdwards Take what!"
"<at>KaneBaldwin Yes I do!"
"Spare me, <at>TravisMays33. He's a Cowboy. They twist stuff up all the time by trying to act like America's Team. America: nation of WINNERS"
"<at>ReeF_NYC Puh-leeze!"
"<at>Jeffsmall46 Yes Sir. Thank You!"
"<at>grossdog7328 Dream On!"
"Preach <at>ThaTruth_. Preach!_"
"<at>KoranClyne_ I know. I didn't mean to say him. Thanks so much for the correction, though. Much appreciated!"
"Puh-leeze, <at>schmeb37. We'd at least be in the conference finals, if not fighting for the championship. Shut your damn mouth :-)"
"Oh, I'm so scared  <at>SBozz9SSP. Spare me!"
"Make the damn playoffs, <at>Will_IKeelYou. And I'll shut up. Until then......HOW 'BOUT THEM COWBOYS!"
"And you're a Cowboys lover, <at>mattstanley10 so that makes you God? SHALLOP!"
"I have no question about <at>DezBryant, <at>Jhooks42. He's bigtime. But the Cowboys STINK! Period. Stop twisting things. Make the damn playoffs."
"Thank You! Thank You! Thank You, <at>Jason_ESPN. Somebody needed to say that."
"You're America's JOKE, <at>_G_NO. How many playoff appearances/victories have you had in the last 17 Years? Kick rocks with that damn nonsense"
"How old were you at the time of their last one? XCwbyKPX. 2 Years Old?"
"Smack yourself for asking such a dumb question, <at>ILoveMyLife7777"
"<at>TheOneToby Next question!"
"Don't listen then, <at>AndreyA487. Does it sound like I'd miss you?"
"The Cowboys are that Fine-as-Hell woman that keeps saying ""Yes"" to a date and ""No"" to every nightcap, <at>hsouza14. Spending all you $$$.:-)"
"About-damn-Time, <at>Jo215. That's what I'll say!"
"Awwwww, <at>benbenman__. Poor Babies :-)"
"<at>GaryLawrence4 So whhat!"
"Lesson: <at>JheriKurlEarl. I spent years accumulating facts to EARN THE RIGHT to express my opinions. 95 percent of industry can't say that!"
"Who gives a damn. Cowboys fans should look at their team then punch themselves for rooting for them!"
"CowboysNation! Relax. I'm <url>ing at y'all as a NY Fan. I'm going to say y'all stink even when you don't. It just happens to be true ..."
"Just wanted to take a moment to extend my sincere congratulations to brother <at>rolandsmartin for being named Journalist of the year for 2013."
"An incredible honor by the National Association of Black Journalist. Proud of you, Bro!"
"Tell'em I don't give a damn, <at>Terryhandley1. They know my number. Who's hiding? I'll <url>e on ESPN Radio in Dallas to say: THEY SUCK"
"<at>JetJerry2408 All that means is that your misinformed!"
"I call it like I see it, <at>Centaur_. When cats deserve scrutiny, I give it. The same with praise. It's called being a grown-ass man. #Fair!"
"Like I've said, <at>jz1210. If that's an ESPN Station, they know the number. I'm not hard to find!"
"No sir, <at>GiftedAndLifted. Only off that one song!"
"<at>jwillzy Goodbye!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, please know if you can't watch your language on my page you will be blocked. Don't make me tell y'all again!"
"The Astros payroll is $25 mil, <at>gnofinder. A-Rod gets paid more than their entire roster this season. Where's <url>mitment to winning?"

"You either don't know what the hell ur talking about, can't see or hear, or don't have Tivo/DVR, <at>ralphlopez41. I've address that many xxx."
"<at>FINO09 I agree with that!"
"<at>MrJayCusto I said he's a nice guy who's never said a bad word about anybody in all the years I've known him. That's all."
"It was not the fight of the century, <at>DanielGross_CO."
"<at>TylerPaschall Can't watch it again! Just can't!"
"<at>Hizzsterr Don't like it. Will discuss tomorrow."

"The spot is the Hard Rock Cafe! All are <url>ed, so long as ya act like you have some damn sense :-)."
"Watch First Take tomorrow. I'll save my fury for then. On a multitude of issues!"
"Thriller-in-Manila (Ali vs. Frazier), enternetpimpin. How 'bout Holyfield/Bowe I. Or Gatti/Ward."
"Big-Time win for the Heat/Bosh. Happy he got the chance to remind everyone the Heat are not all <at>KingJames and <at>DwyaneWade. Way da go!"

"Um, excuse me, <at>mvpdream34. I picked Michigan. And Louisville!"
"<at>CoachKandJoe Sorry! I'm enjoying myself too much!"
"<at>gnellis21 don't need a Bracket. Nat'l TV will do. Look at Friday's FIRST TAKE episode."
"<at>VJaddou that's acttually not true but you're entitled to your beliefs!"
"<at>BauerBeats that is correct. Not with my Bracket for Michigan. Thought Miami would make a Cinderella Ride."
"My heart is with Trey Burke and Michigan, <at>Painfull_33. But I don't like their ballhandling outside of Burke. I'll sleep on it tonight."
"I had the Knicks' winning <url>ing to an end today. I'm loving what I'm seeing. Very Proud!"
"Told you about the language, <at>HarryJohnson313. Goodbye!"
"Idiots, juveniles and ignorant folks with such poor vocabulary that they <url>ment w/o foul language will be blocked INSTANTLY!"
"Btw.....News Flash to Knicks' fans. Being a fan with the Pom Poms is YOUR JOB. Not mine! Even if I do root for the Knicks. DO YOUR JOB!"
"Never, <at>Jakridge13. But I am a S. Beach Fan :-)"
"<at>rb3b3 I refuse to answer that question until tthey give me something beyond the 1st Round."
"Apologize peeps. Had a personal matter to handle. But I'll be back on FIRST TAKE tomorrow morning. Have no doubt Broussard is doing it up!"
"OK, it's official: Knicks are the truth. Victory in Oklahoma City erases any doubt that New York can contend:  <url>    "
"B.S. That was a perfect block by Burke on Siva."
"<at>jcmishkintennis PRESIDENT of B-Ball Operations in the pros."
"Buckle up. FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 is in the house -- and so am I. What a game last night. Holla!"
"Outside of Trey Burke, Hardaway Jr. And Glenn Robinson III needed to have bigger games -- and didn't."
"For those who did not see today's edition of FIRST TAKE, here ya go: <url>"
"<at>BrianSette Evidently you don't listen to us much. We talk about everything. Maybe the problem is your ability <url>prehend."

"Amen, <at>BrandonTierney. Amen!"
"I know the feeling"
"Stop asking me these damn questions. I have no explanation why Woodson won't put in Copeland or Novak or even the towel boy. #Frustrated!"
"Unbelievable to say this....but Chris Copeland MAY BE the Knicks only hope. He's the only want to take pressure off Melo."
"I know, <at>mdesilver. I know."

"Knicks down 29-27 at end of 1st, but I like this. At this pace, Knicks will win this game. Pacers don't excel at this pace."
"Knicks down 19-6 on the boards. Damnit!"
"<at>BrandonTierney Amen, Brother. Couldn't have said it better myself!"
"Yyyyeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"<at>SierraBravo26 Never said that. Flat-out lie!"

"<at>ScrapLotto You're wrong. I said they were not Dirty plays, but LBJ was smart to work the officials early, knowing they'd meet in playoffs."
"<at>DMac_32 Because D-Wade is noticably different. JR looked identical. Just didn't drop shots."

"<at>TheCeva Don't you dare say ""you guys."""
"First take at the top of the hour on ESPN2. The crew's all together in Miami. My prediction <url>ing. Buckle up!"
"Folks need to calm down. As much as it pained me, I picked the Spurs in 7 b/c D-Wade is hurt, and Miami and Bosh haven't looked good."
"And don't get me started on the Spurs depth, consistency, perimeter shooting and how there's no answer for Tony Parker. And what is SA zones"
"I'll be ecstatic is <at>KingJames and <at>DwyaneWade and the crew wins, but LeBron can't do it by himself. And D-Wade at 50 percent isn't enough."
"I may be wrong. Won't mind it one bit. But logic dwarfs everything here. If <at>DwyaneWade were healthy, it would be a no-brainer."
"But <at>DwyaneWade is not healthy. We all know it. So it is what it is. These are the damn SPURS we're talking about here. #Respectthat'searned"

"I'm taking calls from everyone. 800.919.3776."
"What an explosion. Miami was DOWN by 1 pt with 3 minutes left in the third. Then the Heat exploded. Allen and Miller in together is HUGE."
"I'm not going to lie: after hearing the news on Chad Johnson, very little else is on my mind re: Sports right now. I'm so damn disgusted!!!!"
"I simply cannot believe Chad's silliness. You don't play around in court. Especially with a FEMALE judge presiding over DOMESTIC VIOLENCE."
"For those who missed today's edition of FIRST TAKE, HERE YA GO: <url>"

"<at>RicBucher Amen Buddy!"
"Yeah, <at>BrandonTierney. But there's no way in hell the Heat should be down by this little. Spurs actually kept Miami in the game."
"Yes Sir!"
"<at>justfelice how was I wrong. I picked the Spurs."
"<at>_Dbo210 Not to the point where you're causing 2-Hour backups!"
"<at>_LongLivePapi Thank You!"

"I really hope <at>DwyaneWade is okay after attempting to block Duncan's shot. He's playing fantastic."
"I've learned something I already knew just in the last few minutes. The Spurs CANNOT win w/o T. Parker. Even if they go up 3-1."
"Miami's right on course to win this game. It helps that TIAGO SPLITTER is <url>plete waste. And Manu Ginobli isn't must better. On both ends"
"Aaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <at>DwyaneWade has SHOWN UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"<at>NewzFlash23 Told your punk $#*.<at> to watch your language. Consider yourself blocked. Have a nice life!"
"<at>td9867 Skip!"

"I thought Pop should give Gary Neal more PT. Didn't see Ginobili in the starting <url>ing. Gutsy move on Pops' part. Got Ginobili going"
"Here's the deal: D-Wade is the MVP for Miami right now, but tonight is about Pops' brilliant move to START Manu --  somrthing I didn't see."
"With the starters, Manu has lanes open he didn't have before. Mike Miller and others are on him instead of pest like Norris Cole. It's done"
"Wonders for Manu. He's an entirely different player because of it. The Spurs - who've gone small - are an entirely different TEAM b/c of it"
"Now we'll see how Spoelstra responds to Pops latest chess move. It's ain't checkers, that's for sure. We'll know the results in 12 minutes."

"Here's all I'm noticing right now: Tim Duncan ain't trying to have a Game 7. He's trying to finish this off right now."
"Right now, <at>KingJames looks lost. One minute Leonard is on him. The next, it's Diaw. The next, S.A. is collapsing. He doesn't know what 2 do"
"Go 'head <at>KingJames. What a 4th-qt performance. Ginobili has returned to his AWFUL self. If SA loses this game, don't know how they win GM 7"
"<at>cmayeux7 Nope. I'll just be wrong"
"OMG!!!!!!!!!! Tony Parker. Sensational. BigTime. What a game. But LeBron isn't done yet!"

"<at>Daking_12 I don't have to. You'll see."
"Shocked, but loving what I'm seeing from the Knicks right now. Their D looks tough. Bargnani is doing his job. Pacers struggling offensively"
"But Damn! It's still too close for my liking."
"CJ Watson for 3. Now the Knicks are in trouble."
"2 missed wide-open 3's. Knicks lucky, but I'll take it!"

"Wow! What a pass from. Phillip Rivers. CB Can't expect safety help on that play. But...what happened to KC's defense? Picked apart today!"
"Btw....let me not fail to give Christian Ponder kudos for a good day. He actually wasn't bad at all. But I still expect the Packers to win."
"Also, I'm loving what I'm seeing from Carolina, but especially Cam. Didn't seem fazed down 16-3 at all. Cool and Calm. Impressive!"
"Looks like GM is going to lose this game. Minny is forcing them to punt. Unless a fumble occurs, this is over because GM can't stop the run."

"<at>biscardi_john Thanks Bro!"
"<at>PhilsEaglesND That is absolutely correct!"
"<at>EvanHiggins Incorrect!"
"I've tried long enough to be. Cool, but I'm officially concerned about Kidd and the Nets. Houston is STOMPING them right now. #GodAwful!"
"This does not look like some situation where they're just struggling with chemistry. Williams and Lopez <url>e back SOON. Season could be"
"Over by the time they arrive with the way things are looking. This is just bad!"
"Wow! 16.7 second left, down 104-101 to lakers and B. Jennings misses first 2 of 3 FT's. But Jordan Farmar responds by missing both FT's."
"Det still has a chance. Needs to get ball back in Jennings' hands. He was handling things until those missed FT's. Give it back to him!"
"Off. Foul on Josh Smith (Charging). J.S. Had no business making that play. Should've given it up. Hero move."
"2 min left in game and the Wizards don't even have 70 vs. Pacers. I like John Wall, but he might need to be quiet until his team gets better"
"The Knicks are trailing at the half, shotting"
"The Knicks are trailing at the hald in Denver, shooting 9 percent from 3-pt range. Damn! When is my misery going to end with these dudes?"
"Went back to Nets/Rockets Game. Bad news is Rockets have hit 18 3's. Good news is that Nets are only down by 24. #MoralVictories(Ugh!)"
"The Nets had better hope Prokorov isn't looking at their bench. Lost! Lethargic! Demoralized! Lost!"
"Rockets had 31 assists on 39 made baskets. Did what they wanted to do."
"Good to see Jrue Holiday back in Philly. 20 pts, 13 assists. Just saw him hug Jason Richardson. Forget JR was still in the league (injuries)"
"Good game between OkC and Golden State. 24.3 second left,...oKC up 104-103. GSW has missed 6 FT's this quarter. Not good!"
"Amen Brother, <at>daldridgetnt. Amen!"
"Overtime in OKC. Loved that KD was Iso'd, but hated his off-balance, fall-away shot. Should've gotten a better one. Give it to RW b4 that!"
"Smart of RW TO ATTACK rim and get Bogus...I mean BoGUT...to foul out."
"Serge Ibaka....5 blocks vs. SA last game, 4 this game. He patrols the paint like that and KD and RW stay healthy, look out San Antonio."
"Big-time move by Harrison Barnes. Mark Jackson told me he was gonna make even more noise this season. He's got a career-high 26. I like it!"
"Wow! Big-time turn-around 3-pt by Westbrook with 1/10th of a second left. OKC 113-112 lead. Wow!"
"Isiah Thomas just made a very valid point about Westbrook: ""He takes his matchups PERSONAL."" Very true. RW is a Rebel."
"Sorry about the <url>ment earlier. I mean KG. I knew Lopez returned."
"<at>venramamurthy Shallop!"
"Good lawd. JR, shitty turnaround shot. Just awful. And Randy Foye followed up with a 3. Denver up 94-85 with 1:43 left. #DamnDamnDamn!"
"Damnit Foster. I haven't seen too many FG hooks like that bad, but that wasn't a damn False Start penalty on Alabama. Bogus call."
"Look! I wasn't saying he didn't flinch. I'm saying that's a Bogus rule. What are you gonna penalize him for next? Passing Gas. #GoodLord!"
"What the hell is going on! A punter's gonna be the MVP now (Clark)? This is making me depressed already. <at>RealSkipBayless is smiling. Damn!"
"Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!McCarron to Cooper. 99 Yards! Haaaa!!!!!"
"Yyyeeeeaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Who the hell do y'all think y'all are going for it on 4th-and-inches against Bama. Way to do your job Hubbard!"
"RRRRRROOOOLLLLLLLLLLLlLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL"
"TTTTTTIIIIIIDDDDEEEEE!!!!!!!"
"<at>NotTheFakeJeffC Shut the hell up :-)"
"Good Lord. Where the hell was the safety? How was Lewis that open. G. Smith almost blew that one!"
"Btw......real smart of Jones to pop the punter while running out of bounds on that play. Dude may be too busy to put Bama in bad field pos."
"Damn! Damn! I'm so done with this dude Cade Foster. He did everything but kick it into his OL's backside! No wonder the block. #DonewithHim"
"Mother Hubbard! Damn!"
"Btw....as an aside before OT, what the hell was coach Hoke thinking. Who cares that his PLAYERS wanted to go for 2-pt conv? He's the coach!"
"<at>Jim_Hill But he wasn't, so now what!"
"No <at>#*#*<at>$<at>$* way!"
"Unbelievable!"
"Gotta admit, great way for it to end though. <at>RealSkipBayless was right. Give Skip his props. Called it. Said something divine would occur."
"A rarity, but Saban dropped the ball. Didn't have a single athlete on the field for coverage. Was totally unprepared for a 57-yard missed FG"
"And Btw.......the way that FG missed, Griffith should've kicked the previous two Field Goals."
"Awful Awful day for Alabama. They lose a shot at the Nat'l Championship and probably the Heisman (McCarron) too. Devastating!"
"<at>NYCDOTxNWRC I don't bet!"
"<at>Abmilleresquire I didn't cuss. Just used symbols to show you what was in my <url>ing out of my mouth. Calm down!"
"<at>TwerkForErinn_ Now ya know. Roo!"
"<at>mrschmidt3 Haaaaaaa! Now that's funny!"
"<at>DrewWhiteside Oh, Shut up! It's sports you fool. What do you want? Me to sound like a politician. Stop whining!"
"Ii like what I'm seeing from Houston in this Rockets/Spurs' Game. Especially from Terrence Jones. Spreads the floor. Makes Houston's offense"
"Better. Free D-Howard up to operate. Now D-Howard has to capitalize and continue to improve his post-game."
"Real nice pass from Ginobli to Belinelli. I tell ya, SA passes like crazy and Belinelli seems to be THE perfect fit. Could win it all."
"Hope everyone's well. Posted something on my new facebook page: <url> Take a look if ya want to."
"Wouldn't go that far, <at>BrandonTierney. But I'll say this: 7-years, $182 million (avg. $26 mil). Cano deserves that!"
"Testing from my iPhone. Testing from my iPhone"
"Everyone deserves what the market dictates, <at>BrandonTierney. I'm just alluding to what his talent/production warrants. But we'll see."
"<at>CThacarter05 Wouldn't go that far. And you weren't saying that late in the 4th. Too bad the Tide had the worst FG Kicker in history!"
"I addressed that on First Take the next day, <at>mookie_smash. You shouldn't have missed it!"
"I'm sorry, <at>BrendaLarbre. Do you see me on First Take on a Saturday or Sunday? Wait until Monday please!"
"<at>tonyv2527 nope"
"<at>mikeylis Keep watching!"
"<at>Theyankfan1995 Can't rule out anything right now"
"I'm telling you, man, I don't know about this dude Milliner. Bad enough he's struggled with coverage all season, but now you can't tackle?"
"And by the way, what the hell was I thinking in picking the Cardinals. My bad. Forgot all about Carson Palmer. Pathetic performance today."
"<at>lovesdoggs58 all of them. I have multiple TV's and the NFL Package!"
"And now Gould misses a 47-Yarder for Chicago. Does anyone want to win this damn game in Minnesota."
"Switched to a little b-ball. Gotta admit: watching Clips/Pacers. B. Griffin is NOT backing down from West at all. Good battle. If he can be"
"Touch vs. West, he can be tough with anyone else, including his nemesis Zach Randolph. Gotta give Blake a little credit here. Fair is Fair!"
"<at>iAmNumberThree_ No sir. That would be Skip....who took all credit away from everyone b/c Tebow deserved all the credit."
"Manning and Decker should be ARRESTED! What they're doing to the rookie (Cooper) is criminal. Beyond Cruel and unusual punishment. Damn!"
"I cannot believe how many passes KC has dropped today. I've counted 5 in the 3rd QT, alone. Jenkins! Avery! Can't blame Alex Smith for this!"
"Yes. We're ALWAYS READY. First Take in the <url>ing at ya on ESPN2. We're here."
"My apologies for saying on First Take that the Knicks were winless in November. I mean Winless AT HOME! Then again, does it really matter!"
"So much for my damn prediction. I can barely hear with all that noise in Seattle, so  imagine how it is for N.O."
"This is freakin embarrassing. Game over and the first quarter hasn't even ended. I thought I was watching Seattle vs. N.O. -- not the Jets!"
"Okay now! Maybe we will have a game afterall."
"<at>David_F_Ladies We will!"
"I'm sitting here going back-and-forth watching Heat/Pistons, Nets/Nuggets. What. A HIDEOUS damn performance from Brooklyn. Just Awful!"

"Thank you, My. Lord, for giving us Nelson Mandela. Rest in eternal peace!"
"Man, I just left the Knicks Game. What a beatdown. Woodson survives. Melo thrives and the Nets have regressed to a new form of Ugly. Damn!"
"Btw...we'll be discussing famous Jameis on First Take in the AM. I'll wait until then to go ""Primetime"" on Skip and anyone else."
"1 more thing: pay no attention to these embellished Google alerts on Melo. I reported what I've been told and I stand by it. But I never...."
"Once said Melo told me anything because he did not. Melo will say he wants to stay a Knick until he's out the door, as he should."
"Haaaaaa!! I'm just going home from Knicks/Nets. Just turned on the TV. RIGHT IN TIME to witness Shaub's game-deciding INT. #Cannotmakethisup"

"Thank you for the kind words, <at>MtgRecruiter. So thoughtful of you to say!"
"Let me be clear: Feel free <url>e at me all you want about my position of the DA, Politician and Local PD regarding Jameis. I could give"
"Less than a damn! I said an investigation should take place regarding those folks due to their behavior. NOT JAMEIS. He's exonerated. But..."
"Their behavior was beyond inappropriate. It was disgustingly blase. And anyone who thinks otherwise about that presentation can KICK ROCKS!"

"<at>palmettobogey Thank You. He meant the world to all of us."
"What the hell is going on? Where is THE OHIO STATE? Did they forget a trip to the Nat'l Championship is on the line!"
"Big-time stop by MSU on that 4th down. But I've gotta say, Meyer has been somewhat predictable this entire half."
"Oh my goodness. Langford for the TD with 2:16 left. OSU's about to go down. Where's thee 5th ranked rushing defense? Damn. MSU is rolling!"
"Ohio State has 13 total yards in the 4th Quarter this far. Disgraceful!"
"The SEC will play for a Nat'l title....AGAIN!"
"<at>ESegarra86 you don't even want to know. I watched some of the atrocity. Football Sunday is the only thing that prevented me from vomiting"
"This is exactly what infuriates folks about the Lions. How can Stafford and his center make such a mistake on the snap? Simply no discipline"
"Btw.....pleased with Geno and the Jets today. Even if it is vs. the Raiders"
"I swear to Goodness, in aall my years of watching NFL, I've never -- ever -- seen an ending like these last 2 min of Ravens/Vikings."
"Another potentially great finish: Pats/browns!"

"<at>MarkAffue Nobody cares. But I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing from I.T. Also think DeMarcus Cousins could be best big man in the game."

"Amen, <at>BrandonTierney. Damnit!"
"Right now <at>RealSkipBayless looks like a prophet. <url>posed Miami is outplaying an emotional Pacers' squad. Indy needs to calm down. #Relax"
"Mia is forcing turnovers (13 by Indy), negating fast-break opportunities and simply hustling on defense. Indy wants this TOO BAD. Mistake!"
"Listening to my boy, Greg Anthony. He's absolutely correct: Paul George was worse player for Indy in 1st 1/2. Wasn't ready to play vs LeBron"
"Uh oh! Paul George is starting to feel it now. Back-to-Back 3's."
"While Paul george puts on a show, I switch to the Knicks' game and see Coach Woodson looking as if he's on the verge of tears. #SoBadNY!"
"Kyrie Irving's Line: 37, 11 and 1 TO. I know the boy is nice, but is that about HIM, or more about Felton and Pablo? Just a question! Damn!"
"I meant mini-run by George. Hibbert's been the man for Indy tonight!"

"<at>Willmatic559 Agreed!"
"Heat look out-of-sync, outmuscled and <url>bobulated. Plus they're missing FT's. They lose this game and Pacers' confidence will blow up!"
"Good defense with Miami there. If Indiana doesn't stop turning ball over, they may need to do EVERYTHING they can to get Rondo."
"Bigtime jam by LeBron. Making it a 5-pt deficit. 16-6 run by Miami. Whew! It's about to get real up in here."
"I'll always have love for you bro. Call me when you get a chance!"

"Knicks Game. 1st Possession: Turnover by Beno. Jumper from Durant. Right now I'm wondering if the Knicks will lose by 50. Seriously!"
"Okay. I'm going to stop. It REFUSE to be this agitated on Christmas Day. I just Refuse!"

"<at>boobaru162 why? What the on was earth for"
"Greg Hardy and Carolina's front-7 are doing their thing vs. Atlanta. Panthers get the No .2 seed, then NFC playoff pic gets interesting"

"<at>SnowALegend yeah! All you pathetic Cowboys' fans say that. Until y 'all choke, then you're nowhere to be found"

"<at>Sophia_A1621 that's a damn lie. I never said thst"
"Another big-time move by D. Will"

"Btw.....I saw what Steph Curry did to Miami tonight"
"KG was not expecting that pass. The man took just 4 shots this game. Why give him the ball. Not dmsrt"
"<at>Ink_OrangeJuice that's how I roll"

"Practically , CHASE_YSC. Bottom line, I look pretty damn ignorant right now. I'm man enough to admit it. Rollll Tide my you know what!"
"<at>Darkskind_Ayee you wish"
"<at>garystein71 easily. He picked Bama too. They can't protect McCarron"
"Bama gave up 10 sacks all season, and now 6 in one game. Good Lord"
"One other thing I noticed: McCarron can't scramble vs. this defense. His stock has been hurt Bigtime in his last 2 collegiate games."
"This Kid Henry is either a Bigtime player or Okla's run defense stinks"
"Even though that was a swing pass"
"Time to give Okla it's props. Tremendous speed by Striker. Bama' off. Line had a very bad night. Saban 'a got to address that D next season"

"Oh my goodness , I'm starting to get excited. My Knicks might pull this off, especially the way Shumpert is playing. Yeah ! Yeah! Yeah!"
"Big time shot by Felton. 4 min to <url>e on Knicks!!!"
"Felton again. Yes!!!!!"
"Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! Melo for 3 ! From Felton"
"Awwww dn! D-Wade for 3"
"Awwwwwwww. Stay with the slam . And what a game from Felton. 14 assists. Yes!!!!!!"
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!"
"The Lakers are trailing 101-59 with 42.4 seconds left in the 3rd QT. What other evidence do you need to confirm how awful Jim Buss is?#SoSad"

"Good Lawd. Who the hell is Blount ? Jim Brown or Earl Campbell? Jesus!"
"Loved that Carolina went for it, but a QB dice was not the right call. Gotta have more momentum in that dituatin"
"Beautiful throw by Cam. Beautiful catch by the man with the best name in the NFL (Steve Smith). I'm worries about SF with how Kap looks."
"<at>AlmightyStead Hold your horses partner. Not so fast"
"Can't even front: do far Cam just looks unstoppable and Carolina looks like the better team. Simple and plain. Taking too many hits, though."
"What an absolute B.S. call (roughing the passer) vs. Smith in that sack on Cam. No freaking way should that have been called."
"This is beyond tragic, ladies and gentlemen: <url>"

"Amendola didn't have one single catch. I can't wait to hear what <at>RealSkipBayless has to say about that. I wish First Take was on right now."
"See, that right there is a problem. No TD. No 1st down after Wilson is stripped by Smith. Bad sign right there. Damn!"
"49ers offense moving with no urgency whatsoever. I'm really not understanding this at all."
"<url>pletion from Kap to Gore. V. Davis has been exposed <url>plete no-show. Understand C.C. has a lot to do with that but DAMN!"

"Great night with <at>citiprivatepass #EveningWithLegends; enjoyed interacting with <at> SI Peter King <at>jerryrice"
"Man, this pro-Seattle crowd is unbelievable. Never heard it like this for a SB. Plus , Seattle's D looks ferocious. If Wilson gets going?..."
"It's early but it's not looking good for Denver right now."
"Big-time pass by Wilson to Baldwin"
"Manning gets intercepted. Denver is without a first down for the entire 1st QT. Houston, we have a problem. It's the Seahawks!"
"What the hell is this : ET calling home? Manning is on the phone, looking like he's calling for help. Denver <url>pletely rattled. Damn!"
"This is unreal. This could really get ugly for Denver. Real ugly. What's up Manning! What's up!!!!"
"Unbelievable. Tim Tebow's got the <url>mercial this far for Super Bowl Sunday. Unemployed and still making noise. Only in America"
"It's over!"
"This might end up being the biggest blowout in Super Bowl History, the way things are looking right now ."
"Btw....these <url>mercials are terrible. Not moved by any of them. Can I get just 1 funny one, please. Lawdy! Now back to Football"
"Can't front. I am in a state of shock. Manning shut down. <url>pletely outclassed, outcoached, out-muscled. Just unbelievable."
"I hate blowouts in a Super Bowl. But this is legit. Pure domination. If <url>es back from this, it'll be for the ages"
"This is so bad......I may call in sick!"
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but Bruno is turning this out. I can't believe how entertaining this is. This boy is talented."
"This ain't even a game anymore. The only intrigue left is whether or not Manning-and-Co will score. Nothing else."
"This is so embarrassing. Broncos have been totally punked. SB Sunday ruined. It's so bad, next season won't mean anything re: Denver! Why?"
"No matter what Denver does next season we'll remember this beatdown and say: ""Screw Them! We know who they really are."""
"And btw....... If Peyton Manning gets SHUT OUT in this game, no need for anymore talk about him over Montana, Brady, etc."
"Not only was I wrong about  my pick, I actually don't blame folks for wondering what <at>TimTebow would do."
"Denver scores. Congratulations"
"Btw.....there's something wrong when the <url>mercial thus far is the free one by the NFL. What happened to the fun? The laughter?"
"Also, major props to the Seahawks fans. The showed up. Could say Denver fans didn't, but if we're being honest doing we really know ?"
"Come on <at>ChrisBruenn. You know good and well I wasn't saying that's a <url>mercial. Just asking what happened to the laughter"
"Whoa! I see my girl Scarlett in <url>mercial. I get all excited , thinking I 'very seen a <url>mercial. Then... No body shots.#Damn!"
"This SB is so bad, it's even ruined Seattle's celebration. They've gotta wait to jump for joy. Even Marshawn is chillin w/ shoes off ."
"This game was so bad, it ended before 10pm. When's the last time a Super Bowl ended this early"
"<at>ClaytonDavidl Stay scared of the Truth: ME!!!!!! Nothing pleases me more"
"<at>ryanamspaugh Watch Peyton Manning under pressure , it serms"
"<at>domuigi Maybe. Everyone for Denver was awful , including John Fox. They should all be ashamed. Much respect to Harbaugh's 49ers 4 fighting."

"Yes I did, <at>PCBearcat. <at>Rich30Everley. And I just went on SPORTSCENTER and said he should be suspended 3-to-5 games. You can't do that."
"There's nothing to talk about. Marcus Smart should be suspended 3-to-5 games. A college athlete has no business putting his hands on a fan."
"Especially a middle-aged man. Marcus Smart, by all accounts, is a good kid who made a mistake. He should be allowed to recover from this."
"BUT....you don't do what he did. It can't be allowed. It's not just about Smart. It's about sending the message that such behavior won't fly"
"Correct <at>JGeewentworth. And the fan should be dealt with Harshly. But that doesn't excuse Marcus. He could've called an official or someone."
"There were other ways to deal with this, <at>JGeewentworth. Smart 'a reaction can 'to be excused. Doing so gives the license to others. Period."

"So I wake up, turn on the TV and the 1st thing I see is Raymond Felton arrested on gun charges. 2 Felony Counts. Good Goodness. #Betrayal"
"I'm talking betrayal to Mike Woodson. JR starts the season in trouble. T. Chandler sounded off. Now this. How does that make Woodson look."

"To touch him. Canelo does not need to take shots from this dude , although Angulo isn't getting leverage on any of his shots."
"Canelo looks like he's getting stalked. Angulo <url>ing and Canelo, although having won every round, seems like he's slowing down."

"<at>RDunc23 you were saying?"
"Angulo is loaded with heart , but isn't that smart . He's chasing/following , but not cutting off the rim ."
"Wow! Round 8. Canelo taking shots. Talking smack, throwing back. If he can truly handle that heat, no one can touch him but Floyd."
"Good body and head movement by Canelo. His defense has improved tremendously. He keeps this up , Cotto's next. Then rematch vs. Floyd. #Must"
"Fight stopped. Terrie stoppage. Should not have been stopped. Angulo was taking shots but still standing and swinging. Had not been down."
"Wrong judgement call by ref. No warning. No anything. Wrong decision. Just flat- out wrong"

"This kid Early is an NBA talent. But Randle, no matter how young, how raw, could be a star. That size with that handle,....nice! Great Game!"
"This is the best college game I've seen all year. My man Greg Anthony is doing an outstanding job calling this game. A heavyweight for sure"

"<url>es back in the game. KY's problems from the perimeter resolved!"
"Lord Have Mercy. What a dunk by Poytress"

"Guard play, Guard play, Guard play. Looking good right now. <at>RealSkipBayless."
"<at>extraORRdINary <at>RealSkipBayless If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. You barely get to see these guys. Now.... NFL and NBA? I take it personal"
"My goodness. Everything one of the Harrison's drive , they're getting stripped. Get the ball to Randle"
"Kentucky has no answer for Napier. He looks like he can do what he wants, and knows it. Wow! KY's best hope is to get it to Randle down low."
"I've rarely seen Calipari looking this helpless. KY totally rattled. Can't hold onto the ball."
"I cannot believe this. KY can't drive. Can't hold into the ball. This might be a blowout if they don't get their act together fast"
"Look damnit, put a Box-and-1 on Napier. Deny him the ball. Don't let him shoot. Whatever it takes. Mug the damn man if you have to. JESUS!!!"
"It's a miracle Kentucky isn't down by 20 at the break. I'll admit that much <at>RealSkipBayless. Gotta say, I love Ollie saying what he said at"
"The half. ""We're a second-half team too. No backing down. Love his attitude."
"There's no way Kentucky is winning this Nat'l Championship with Julius Randle taking just 3 shots. #Blasphemy"
"<at>Tuanzilla <at>SweetUKGirl He damn sure looks like it"
"Smart of Ollie to delay UConn's pressure . He knows he can't rely on his bench in the second half. He's saving Napier for the end"

"Kentucky literally throwing away this game."
"UNTIL that Dunk by Young. Wow!!"
"Good point <at>RealSkipBayless. I can't deny that. But your boys are still losing. Haven 'to had a lead yet"

"Btw....in case anyone hasn't noticed, anyone feeling the need to cuss or call me out my name is instantly blocked. Grow up. Let's talk ball."
"13-of-23 from Free Throw line. If Kentucky loses this game , that'll be a big reason why. But I'll give Napier and Boatright most of credit."
"Yo <at>RealSkipBayless I told you this <url>e down to the wire. We'll see who shows up."
"Someone should kidnap Napier right now. Tie his shoelaces together. Spike his drink, his towel. Something! Just don't let him shoot"
"Kentucky blew this in the last minute if this game. Sorry, but they didn't seem prepared. They just didn't"
"Congrats <at>RealSkipBayless. Ya got this one"

"The convo with me and Dr. Dyson was necessary and long overdue. No matter your belief, so long as it's thoughtful, we all learn from this."

"<at>HHConservative Appreciate it but don't need it. <url>fortable with my position and I'm not budging one inch"
"The fact that you would say I said that shows 1 of 2 things about you , AWills07 <at>RayRice27. You <url>prehend English or it a liar. !"
"Watching this game, the Spurs could be in huge trouble if they don't figure out how to deal <url>bo of Ibaka and Adams"
"Good Lawd. That stroke from <at>KDTrey5  is too sweet for words. And Tony Parker looks as if he's scared to make a play vs <at>russwest44. Damn!"
"<at>Alex_Nemec haaaaa"
"Wow! What an explosion. OKC has 20 assists and only 6 TO's. And <at>russwest44 is playing lights out. We ourselves a Western Conference Finals."
"It's 8 minutes left in the 3rd QT and Indiana has just 37 points. How much more pathetic can you be!"
"What a Bigtime performance by Paul George. Sensational. What we've been waiting for all-season-long."
"Stupid play by Hill. All he had to do was hold the damn ball. Attempting a contested layup at that point serves no purpose"

"I'm back in the house. And I harbor no responsibility for what <at>RealSkipBayless will say about <at>KingJames with his hatin' self. Buckle up!"
"Chillin in San Antonio, but just wanted to take a moment to send out a prayer for <at>RealTracyMorgan following accident this AM. #GodBless."
"Whoa! Cotto 3 knockdowns in the 1st Round. Martinez badly hurt. Cotto left hook."
"Hey, Cotto looks superb. His defense. Power. Left hook. I don't have Cotto losing 1-single round yet thru the first 8. #MayweatherCotto2"
"Make that 9-0 thru nine rounds. And I don't want to hear anything about Martinez' knee. He's getting annihilated."
"Martinez trainer throws in the towel. It's over. Cotto by TKO."
"A quick break in the action? Here's something for y'all from <at>RealSkipBayless and myself."
"Yes. Unfortunately,  I know you won't :-)"
"Yes! I do have. <url>mercial. This time: Beats By Dre. Check it out: <url>"
"Haaa! Haaaa! Check out the <at>ESPN_FirstTake remix for the top of the show today in Miami: <url>"
"I'm totally shocked by how Miami just didn't show up to play tonight. Leonard outplayed everyone, but Mia also got NOTHING from Chalmers."
"Heard all the noise over my saying <at>carmeloanthony & <at>KingJames could pair-up someday. Enough! Read and learn: <url>"
"For those who don't know, <at>ESPN_FirstTake is only on for an hour today, and it's on ESPNews -- not ESPN2"
"Mia looks terrible on offense. Not moving the ball. Forcing passes when they do. On D, doubling unnecessarily. Just out of sync"
"I am stunned at the way the Heat are looking right now. They keep this up, it's over by Sunday. Hey! At least I'd be home by Monday."
"Ladies/Gentlemen, what we are witnessing is a good ole fashion ass whipping (excuse my language). D-Wade has no legs. LBJ looks exhausted"
"I'll admit it right now: I dropped the ball. Mia looks totally gassed. Out of shape. The Spurs are accustomed to running out West. It shows."
"Yes I do.  And I don't care"
"On ESPN Radio (98.7FM) in NYC from 1-3pm today w/o my man. <at>RyanRuocco. I'm all by my lonesome. But the LOVE DR. Will join in:) 800.919.3776"
"The Love Dr has been requested again. He's up next on ESPN NY (98.7FM). <at>Oprah or <at>OWNTV may not show enough love to is men, but I'm here :)"
"<at>teddysanders1 Thank You my man. I really do need it"
"This flight from Miami on <at>AmericanAir is just disgraceful. Sitting on the plane for 2 hours. Paperwork hasn't arrived! Just damn ridiculous"
"No, I am not on my way yet <at>AmericanAir. I'm told we'll leave shortly........for the 10th time now"
"Whew! If y'all are not watching this Djokovic/Federer match, turn the damn channel. Get in front if a TV. It's special right now."
"Match is back and forth but Federer looks potent when charging the Net. But this IS Djokovic he's going against here, who's winning, btw."
"Djokovic has broken Federer's serve 3 straight times."
"<at>ContendaGOTEM watch First Take and SPORTSCENTER tomorrow and find out"
"Don't y'all dear start asking me questions about <at>KingJames & <at>carmeloanthony. Me and <at>RealSkipBayless r back tomorrow on <at>ESPN_FirstTake"

"<at>MikeFSU10 Thanks"
"<at>von_mostwanted Thank you"
"<at>matthertz Thank you for acknowledging how ignorant you are. I've broken too many stories in my career for such a dumb statement. #Goodbye."

"<at>DarkoStateNews Fiction"
"<at>KingLebron10 No ! What will help Tennis most is am American male <url>ing Federer or Djokovic"
"<at>Dg21 none of your business"
"<at>JordanMWilhite Thank you. Sincerely"
"My plan was to wait for <at>ESPN_FirstTake in the AM. But <at>SportsCenter has called me for duty. Here <url>e. Approx 11:30pm. Buckle Up!"
"Or probably on a few minutes earlier."
"On in 5 minutes, gents. <at>SportsCenter. Check it out."
"Less than 20 min away from SHOWTIME. <at>ESPN_FirstTake is baaaaaccckkkk! ESPN2 at 10am. Holla!"
"I'm sorry folks. I hate having to go off on Josh Gordon like that. But the brother is special/Bigtime. It sickens me to see him do this."
"Neither myself nor anyone can help him by giving him a pass. I want him to have a great career but he's got to clean up his damn act."
"Just 20 min away from hitting the radio waves with my man <at>RyanRuocco on ESPN Radio (98.7FM) in NYC. Call-in# 800.919.3776. Holla!"
"Get the hell up and get ready. Your boy is back in the house on ESPN Radio (98.7 FM) in NY.  800.919.3776. #HollaAtYourBoyyyyyyyyss"

"<at>1truseatlefan Turn the damn channel then. Nobody asked your $&<at> to watch. Bye!"
"<at>jsprinkles Holla at me when you get a chance. Need to rap about something"
"Nothing in the world can ruin my day today. My man <at>MauriceBenardMB from General Hospital came on <at>ESPN_FirstTake today. I'm in HEAVEN.  Haa"
"<at>MaxxWavy Thanks bro. Appreciate the love"
"<at>GeorgeXjr4 <at>MauriceBenardMB That might work"
"I am at the ESPY's y'all. And I don't care what anyone says: Drake is freaking hilarious. Skits with Blake Griffin/ Imitating Pacquaio#Haaa"
"Can't believe all this nonsense about Tony Dungy. Check out. <at>ESPN_FirstTake right now"
"I'm gonna repeat right here what I just said on <at>ESPN_FirstTake: I do NOT have a problem with what Tony Dungy said. For a couple of reasons:"
"A.) Dungy's quote stated the obvious. Some folks wouldn't touch Sam because they, essentially, know their locker room and could do w/o it."
"B.) from a religious perspective, he's been consistent on his views. Period."
"Again, I've always been an adversary of Gay Prejudice. No room in our society for it. But that doesn't mean someone can't express Dungy's"
"Sentiments. It's life. We've got to deal with it. We'll continue to learn and grow"
"<at>jesusjunkey And you're sending this to me because????????"
"<at>HePharreal Damn right. Luck is a bad boy."
"<at>jquinlan24 Yeah! But he was cognizant enough to pick JACKIE, as opposed to a host of others who were deemed more qualified as players."
"<at>JackHerer16 <at>RealSkipBayless Get over it."
"<at>gotham_city2355 Now you're learning."
"<at>bretta45 Good. So go and get me <url>mercial, or a new movie deal."
"<at>JessiejNelson Thank you so much for your kind words"
"<at>mettajoshkatz Does your ignorant self have something else <url>plain about. You argument is old."
"Uh oh! <at>RealSkipBayless in a different kind of mood today. Must be <at>KingJames or <at>JManziel2. I'll try to keep him calm on <at>ESPN_FirstTake"
"<at>3letterman <at>RyanRuocco Amen"
"Just to re-cap my thoughts for today: I'd NEVER forgive Conseco if I were McGwire. And <at>KingJames is right to get his $$$ when teams are"
"in the NBA are being sold for $2-Billion. If owners can get their money, why are players always being asked to take a pay cut."
"<at>colewagoner Doesn't mean I deserve to be asked to take less than my market value."
"Of course we know the reasons, <at>jamesblair06. That ain't the point. The point is: There's always something limited <url>pensation."
"<at>blacksamoan300 Damn right!"
"<at>RealRickSanders I'm totally damn disgusted. How the hell do you think I feel about it."
"That's a good point, <at>jamesblair06. But a predictable one. The system was designed for that scenario and the NBPA agreed. Still isn't right"
"So let me get this straight <at>theRealRudyLara. The Brothers should be happy with what they're getting? Even if they're worth more? #Hmmmm"
"<at>Alford908 False."
"Don't forget why players will look bad <at>razzell2. It's because the public has been convinced they're bad b/c they should be THANKFUL.#Sad"
"<at>HammerTime1387 Perhaps you're dumber for even responding."
"<at>nwcdb__ Thank you."
"<at>BrooklynPoet94 Thank you, sincerely!"
"I'm totally ticked off, <at>kicklace. they'd better hope good and damn well I don't talk about this."

"You've been waiting to hear from me. Now you will in approx 30 minutes. <url>ing at ya at 10am. No one's hiding!"

"Just 30 min away. Day 3 of the new Stephen A. Smith Show on SiriusXM MadDog Radio (Channel 85). Time for some F-Ball. 888.MadDog6."
"Man, Beast Mode is running all over these dudes. If GB doesn't figure out Lynch this is gonna be a long, long night"
"Oh shut the hell up <at>cartelfatal. Are the CowGirls playing tonight? Mind your damn business and watch the game. You wish Dallas had Rodgers."
"<at>OldGuysRule01 we both picked Seattle to win this game"
"Damn. Rodgers had the first down and threw it away. Plus, I really have a problem with not one pass being thrown <at>RSherman_25 way. #Damn!"
"Weak call against Brad Jones. Sacked turned into a 1st down. As if Seattle needs additional help. Jesus!"
"<at>kajundiva21 if you always agreed with me, what kind of show would it be"
"<at>JoeBOBaHead Their defense is suspect. They'll still win the NFC North though"
"<at>chad_patrick Please do. I promise I won't miss ya"
"<at>mikellie2 I don't have to WISH anything. Been getting paid to do it for 2 decades. While you follow my every move. Get a damn life."
"Big stops by GB at end of half, then start of second half. Seattle could've had the game rapped up by now if GB's D had folded. They didn't"
"So much for that notion. A-Rod was at fault there. Bad pass to Jordy Nelson"
"Beast Mode on the way"
"GB's off line can't handle this pass rush.  Bennett? Williams? Doesn't matter, especially with Bulaga out and Sherrod getting abused.#Over!"
"Day 4 of the new Stephen A. Smith Show on SiriusXM MadDog Sports Radio (channel 85) is about to begin right now. Call in: 888.MadDog6."
"Wth! Redskins special teams a disaster again? Damn! Ya know what: just give the ball to Morris and call it a day. Texans can't stop him."
"It's just a matter of time before my man <at>RealSkipBayless sees Johnny Football. Cleveland's offense looks awful"
"I can't believe how awful the Eagles have been. Can't hold onto the ball. Can't protect Foles. Who are these dudes !"
"I know Foles can't only do but so much with backups protecting him on the OL, but <url>e on!"
"WTH. I leave for a second and what do I return to: actual games taking place in Philly, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Baltimore, afterall. Yes!"
"Not the Pittsburgh part, though. Can't have my Steelers losing today"
"Can't wait for my shows tomorrow. Eagles, Steelers, Falcons, Patriots and, ofcourse, this owner for the Atlanta Hawks. Just can't wait."
"Aaaahhhhhh haaaaa! Accidents waiting to happen. Ahhhhaaaaa! How 'Bout Them Cowboys. Hhaaaa haaaa. They/Romo just never let me down. #Whew!!!"

I'LL-BE-WAITING!"
"And please be clear: I'm encouraging BLACK folks to call on this issue. I'm sick and damn tired of us attacking one another just because"

"just the ignorant damn few. And you know who the hell you are. I'll be on the air at 1pm. SiriusXM MadDog Radio, Channel 85. # 888.623.3646"

"I can't get to SiriusXM soon enough to do my radio show. I can't believe this. Talk to ya'll at 1pm. SiriusXM MadDog Radio (Channel 85)."
"Let's be clear: I specifically said Goodell should not have to resign ABSENT any evidence that he saw the rice' tape months earier. #UhOh!"

"Good TD pass by Hudson Mason. Damn good game. Just find myself feeling like neither GA nor SC will make much noise this season"
"You're not looking at the big pic <at>Jayncs. It's not about Ferry. It's about opening the box you don't wanna open. Ever think about what WE"
"Say behind closed doors <at>Jayncs. If you're gonna be quick to get someone FIRED over that, where the hell does that leave US! #THINK"
"<at>CHAZ2923 none of your damn business :-)"

"Ya know what: I think I'm gonna give y'all a round-by-round critic of the Mayweather demolition tonight! Stay Tuned!!!"
"To be quite honest with y'all, I'm yawning already. If Maidana TOUCHES his face I'll be pleasantly shocked. Expect a boxing exhibition."
"Mayweather moves and moves. Relatively boring round with nothing more than a Skip from Floyd. Maidana stalks though. #floydRound1"
"Floyd is running a bit more than usual. Will admit that"
"Maidana catches Floyd with a couple of looping shots. Floyd gets ticked off. Unloads check hooks and straight rights. Floyd wins Round 2"
"Oh Damn! Maidana catches Floyd with a  hard round to end around 3. Caught him. Floyd wins Round 3 but was dazed for a second"
"Yes, I'm admitting it. Floyd got hit in the face."
"Round 4. Maidana is on the attack. Floyd is getting hit. What the hell is he doing???????"
"Okay, Floyd looks to be employing the rope a dope. Jabs to the body to set up the right. Maidana wins round though. Getting very interesting"
"Floyd moving. Hitting with jabs, counter punches and straight shots. Maidana answering with double l-hooks. Floyd wins round but is tired!"
"He can't breath after taking that shot to the nose is Round 4"
"Floyd wins Round 7. Left ear and mouth seems to be bleeding and Floyd looks to be fatigued. Getting in the corner too much. Maidana stalks"
"Whoa! Fight stalled with 19sec left in Round 8....Maidana BITES Floyd. Round goes to Zfloyd"
"Floyd wins Round 9, but basically by default. Both are missing. Floyd looks slower and heavier than usual. But did connect a couple times"
"Maidana docked pt for throwing Floyd to canvas. He's swinging wildly but missing mostly. Floyd is just too elusive for this dude."
"Floyd wins Round 11. Same ole same ole"
"I had Maidana winning 1 round, which was Round 4....aside from being given Round 12 because Floyd simply stayed away."
"I applaud Floyd for acknowledging he deserved a C-minus grade for his performance. He didn't have it. He was slow. He could be better. And.."
"He will be for Manny Pacquaio . Book it. <url>ing. Mark my words."
"Floyd needs to stop showing everyone his hand. We know he got bite, but it wasn't his ear. Plus, his nose and lip got busted. #ugh"

"Keep in mind, I picked Toronto to win this series, but here's a huge problem it has: Wall can hold Lowry in check. That's a huge problem."
"Paul Pierce is putting on a show. Meanwhile, Toronto has not adjusted to Wizards smaller lineup and they are not hitting perimeter shots."
"Raptors starting to penetrate into teeth of Wizards D. Here <url>e. But Beal also needs to play better. If he does, Wizards grab Game 1"
"It's the 4th QT and the Raptors, one of the top offenses in the game, doesn't even have 60 pts. Is this about their offense or Wizards' D?"

"Wizards can't play as well as they've played then lose this game. A loss will be devastating"
"Great move by Beal. Got Lowry out the game. Toronto's in trouble. Not that they weren't already of course. Not a good game for Lowry"
"What a Game. Wizards almost blew it. Looking good right now, though"

"Hey <at>RealSkipBayless didn't I say Hoyer was good for at least 2 to's? That last one was horrendous. No wonder he's gone from Cleveland!"
"Another INT by Hoyer. This is one God-Awful performance. If bench him right now. Even if it's for the Waterboy"
"On another note: so let me get this straight. Adam Case is the new HC in Miami b/c of the job he did with Peyton Manning (& Cutler)? The..."
"Job he did with Peyton Manning....who established his greatness 15 yrs b4 Gase ever stepped onto the scene? Really? I tell you, man......."
"Almost another INT. We are literally at a point that if you're rooting for Houston, you're praying Hoyer doesn't even throw the ball."
"I mean, why is Hoyer still on the sidelines? Why doesn't he just leave the stadium right now, go home, pack and leave town for good!"
"Is it too much to ask for the Steelers to just throw the damn ball away? Big Ben gets hurt b/c he didn't do it and Landry just takes a sack!"
"Damn!!!"
"If the <at>steelers lose this game, it's on Big Ben. You throw the ball away, there's no sack, you don't get hurt and u have a 15-pt cushion."
"Burfict should be ejected immediately, and suspended. And if Bengals lose this game b/c of that hit, it's JUSTICE! No excuse!"

"Fans at the game applauding when Big Ben got hurt, throwing stuff at him. Burfict & Pacman totally out of control. & Marvin Lewis has no"

"I'll say this about Burfict: If Joey Porter was on the field cussing out Cincy players, Burfict is right that he should've been penalized."
"I feel <url>fortable picking <at>Seahawks. I see Seattle winning this game 19-9 over the <at>vikings."
"Bogus flag vs Kam Chancellor. Doesn't matter though. Too damn cold. Oh well!"
"OMg! I cannot believe the Vikings' kicker Walsh missed that chip-shot FG. Even more, I can't believe he's out there shaking hands with SEA.."

"Nobody open for Aaron Rodgers. No protection from the off. Line. <at>Redskins should have a field day."
"I must confess, even to <at>RealSkipBayless: some of these receivers ARE actually open for Aaron Rodgers. He has just missed them. Period"

"<at>bakerjrock Thanks Bro"
"<at>BillyBlasting you are correct. For now"
"Great pass from Coker....a 38-target to Stewart. Finally......a 3rd down converted. About damn time.#championshiptake"
"Yeah! Easy throw for Coker to O.J. Howard. Blown coverage. Clemson trails in 4th QT for 1st time all season. Now what? #championshiptake"
"Wwwwhhhheeewwwwww!!!!!! What a big time return by Drake. Big time! But there's still plenty of time. Watson's a beast.#championshiptake"
"See what I'm saying. Clemson TD. At least they stopped the 2-point conversion, though. Now Bama MUST not give ball back.#championshiptake"
"I agree with Herbstreit about McKenzie Alexander. That play to Howard wouldn't have happened if he were in the game.#championshiptake"
"You have got to be kidding me. Another timeout used? Good Lord.#ChampionshipTake"

"If <at>KDTrey5 & <at>russwest44 are going to stay together the <at>okcthunder need to get a true PG. <url>"

"My Game 7 pick: <url>"
"I asked for the Oakland & Cleveland police departments to put out an APB for <at>hbarnes. <url>"
"So far, Steph is messin up. Playing around with the ball, whining after missed shots and not getting back on D. Only two things worse 4 now:"
"A.) LEBRON hasn't looked for his shot enough, + has turned the ball over 3 times. B.) Harrison Barnes is a no-show again. Just sit him down!"
"All I know is....<at>Money23Green has been SPECTACULAR in this first half. So much so, they need to look to get him open just as much as Steph!"
"If I'm Kerr I bench Barnes and Ezeli RIGHT NOW. Both look scared and Ezeli is just too soft right now.#TissuePaperAlert"
"Alert: <at>StephenCurry30 is blowing this game. Turning the ball over entirely too much. And Kyrie is turning it one. <at>warriors are in trouble"
"Btw Steve Kerr, how about getting Draymond Green open"
"No high energy from this crowd either. They are nervous as hell at the Oracle"
"Barnes finally hit a couple of shots. And <at>StephenCurry30 stopped turning ball over. <at>KingJames only has 16. So why do I believe LBJ is on"
"The verge of going off? Actually, either <at>KingJames or <at>StephenCurry30! One of them is about to explode."
"Just 12 min left, a 1-pt game with a championship on the line and 6 of the last 8 league MVP's on the court vs one another. Can't get better"
"It's just nearly 6 min left and a 2-pt game in a Game 7 of the NBA Finals. My season <url>plete. I couldn't be happier right now!"
"An absolutely dumb behind the back pass by <at>StephenCurry30, followed by a 3 from <at>KingJames. What the hell is Curry doing?"
"3:40 left. Game tied in Game 7. Who's the damn Man right now? Who????"
"I cannot believe what I'm seeing right now. <at>StephenCurry30 bad? Nervous? Hurt? Don't know what the hell it is, but it's something. And...."
"What about that block by <at>KingJames? Sensational. He's handled business down the stretch. But now we'll see"

"DeShaun Watson is just special.<at>ChicagoBears should be sick for passing on him, as well as the <at>nyjets. Legion of Boom no more????#Hmmm"
"As for Kirk Cousins and the <at>Redskins they just are what they are: good enough to be <url>pelling. But simply don’t win enough."
"Damnit Bill O’Brien. Why so damn conservative? Put the ball in Watson’s hands. Let him make the call to run or throw."
"BTW.....major props to <at>DeAndreHopkins. After all this noise, he showed up and BALLED. Did his JOB. That’s what I wanted to see.#Respect"
"Great drive by <at>Seahawks. If <at>HoustonTexans lose, this in on O’Brien or the O-coordinator. Keep the ball in Watson’s hands & likely win."
"BTW......it’s amazing how <at>HoustonTexans did is practically non-existent without J.J. Watt in lineup. Totally different defense"
"Major props to <at>HoustonTexans though. Fought valiantly. And I like O’Brien but man, you’ve got to take chances. Watson is special. Roll Dice"
"Yeeaaaahhhhh!!! <at>steelers defense holds — in Red Zone again. Now all Big Ben has to do is get 1st Down. Give it to me fellas! Bring it home"
"Why the hell are the <at>steelers throwing the football right then on 2nd down and stopping the clock? I swear I wonder about Haley sometimes."
"I’m done. This WS is just ridiculous. Insane. After Springer makes an EGO mistake instead of staying in front of the ball, losing the lead,"
"Springer turns around and shows massive heart with a solo blast at the bottom of the inning with a 480-Ft homer. Lord have mercy.#Crazy"
"I don’t mind saying this to anyone: Watching Altuve throughout these playoffs, I haven’t felt this excited since watching Barry Bonds!"
"And now Correa. This is unreal. I know Marrow should’ve been taken out. He needs a day. But w/ <at>astros, would it really make a difference?"
"Amateur play by Pederson there. What the hell are you watching for. RUN....FORREST....RUN. Would’ve easily had triple, possibly inside HR"
"Man, Baseball is out the window. Strategy! Mechanics! Gone! This is all about heart & guts. Simple & plain"
"Are you kidding me? Now Puig hits a HR with one hand. 2-run shot. It’s now 12-11. I can’t! I just can’t!"
"Tie Game. Taylor single up middle. Guess that means HOUSTON wins at bottom of inning because <at>Dodgers have no pitching left. They’re spent!"
"Even if Jansen stops them in 9th, there’s the 10th, considering the way this game has gone"
"Every time Altuve swings hard at first pitch and misses, he usually ends up smacking home run. I have that feeling now"
"Whew!"
"Bad loss for <at>Dodgers. All they seem to have is Jansen and the <at>astros don’t fear him. Now, Verlander is 9 innings away from title. Not good"

"ICYMI... National Distribution of The Stephen A. Smith Show Debuts Jan. 2. <url>"
"Thank you <at>MikeAndMike. <url>"
"Whoa! <at>sixers dropped 47 on the <at>warriors in the first QT. Covington hitting 3’s from everyone. But it IS only the 1st QT. Still exciting to watch!"
"Oh My Damn! <at>sixers outscored 47-15 by <at>warriors in the 3rd QT. Lord Have Mercy!"
"Watching the end of this <at>ChicagoBears vs <at>Lions game. Snap? Perfect! Hold? Perfect! Kick by Connor Barth? Beyond atrocious. Waaaaay wife right. Wasted damn-good closing drive by Trubisky. So sad how kickers can ruin a game."
"Not surprised at all the <at>Vikings beat the <at>RamsNFL either. Their defense is big time. <at>RamsNFL offense? I needed to see them against a defense like this to believe. Came in w/ questions about Rams & left w/ them, too."
"As for the <at>Redskins I figured they’d show up today and play. Nobody’s thinking about them, so there’s no pressure. They wait for expectations to actually wet the bed and disappoint you."
"Although <at>Saints just scored another TD and pulled within 31-29. Now they need the 2-pt conversion"
"The GREAT Drew Brees is 11-for-11 on last two drives after <at>Saints trailed 31-16 with under 5 min left. Now they’ve scored on 2-pt conversion. Game tied 31-31. Let’s see what <at>Redskins do now."
"Now <at>Saints can’t get a stop when they need it. <at>Redskins in field goal range to win it. <at>Saints’ defense? Who Dat!"
"Intentional grounding by Kirk Cousins. WTH! Cost <at>Redskins 10 yards and 10. Stupid mistake by Cousins, who’s been otherwise great today. We’re going to OT, y’all"
"<at>Giants beat <at>Chiefs in OT. Alex Smith and that offense was awful today. And in case y’all are missing this, <at>buffalobills bench Tyrod for a 5th-Round Rookie (Petersen), who’s already thrown 2 INT’s. Looking bad for them right now."
"Ingram is running all over the <at>Redskins right now. They’re either worn out or simply can’t stop him. Gruden looks lost on the sidelines. Understood. <at>Saints just won the game. As great as Cousins was, couldn’t stop bleeding when it counted."
"BTW......<at>Redskins are officially done, for all of you who were wondering."
"Osweiler just flung a football into middle of the field w/looking. Lucky it wasn’t intercepted. Dude is so lucky. I see certain guys in this league QBing, and it just makes me think more about <at>Kaepernick7. <at>KingJames knows he’s blackballed like rest of us."
"The <at>buffalobills’ rookie QB — who Tyrod Taylor was benched for — has thrown 3 Int’s in his first 9 passes, all in the First Quarter. Experiment/Risk by McDermott isn’t looking go good right now"
"My bad. Petersen has FOUR — Yes, 4 — interceptions for the Bills. I know he’s just a rookie, but if you’re going to bench Tyrod Taylor, it doesn’t need to be for someone who’s doing things we haven’t seen done since 2002."
"What a disastrous day for the the <at>buffalobills. Petermen’s FIVE interceptions and subsequent benching leaves McDermott with an awful lot of explaining to do. The <at>RAIDERS disastrous tendencies need to be addressed to"
"Perhaps someone can explain to me how the <at>Patriots are suppose to have this awful defense — although it’s improved — and yet <at>derekcarrqb and the <at>RAIDERS can’t score a single damn point? What has happened to these guys?"
"H Lord. Brock Osweiler has the ball, needing to go 80 yards for a <at>Broncos win or about 45 to 50 yards for a tying FG. Why is it that I have ZERO faith in him?"
"4-and-out! No doubt adding insult to the loss, Vontaze Burfict goes over and hugs Osweiler after he flops, as if to say: “Thank You Brock....for being YOU.”Damn!!!"
"Btw.......I know Osweiler and Burfict are friends. Wasn’t speaking to Burfict’s intent. Just that folks who may not know they’re friends may have looked at it differently, because of how little Osweiler is thought of"
"Daaaaammmmmmnnnit! <at>Eagles give up 61-Yards on opening <url>e on! Damn!"
"Yeah! Yeah! Eagles = Touchdown."
"Int not on Dak. That was about Bell —- Dallas’ latest experiment at left tackle — getting beat and Dak having to rush pass. Ball tipped too. Don’t matter. Garrett and Linehan have to resolve that. Question is: Are they capable"
"You’ve gotta be kidding me. Elliott - a Damn practice squad player - misses gimme FG after interception. <url>e away with nothing! Damn! Damn! Damn!"
"Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhh Haaaaaa!!!! How ‘Bout Dem Cowboys!!!!!!! I’m out y’all. This game is a rap. See y’all tomorrow on <at>FirstTake.....and The Stephen A. Smith Show on ESPN Radio. This will be an ALL DAY AFFAIR. Haaaaaaa!!!!!!!"

"My Thanksgiving gift to <at>dallascowboys fans. <url>"

"I’m all about Roll Tide....since Nick Saban arrived. But let’s be very clear: they’re getting spanked today. Would love to see a rematch for the Nat’l Title, but I am just one of those guys who does not believe in Jalen Hurts. He’s just not that dude."
"Time for <at>FirstTake on ESPN. Let’s Go!!!!!!!"
"I’m about to do a Facebook Live post right now. I’m pissed off!"
"WTF......is right. I’m with <at>KingJames and <at>DwyaneWade on this one. What possible justification is there for Memphis firing Coach Fizdale?"
"Oh Hell Yes! There’s a lot to talk about today. <at>KingJames. Fizdale’s Firing. <at>KDTrey5 on <at>Kaepernick7 and being BLACK in America. And then some. <at>FirstTake is in the house on ESPN. And so am I. Hell Yeah!"

"The <at>memgrizz's choice to fire Fizdale raises more questions about the franchise than the coaching. <url>"

"A couple of things: If I were those reporters I would not have moved when <at>mosesbread72 told them to get away from Quinton Jefferson. They have a job to do like everyone else. Having said that, he’s right: Those fans were dead wrong. Who the hell were they to throw things <at> him!"
"Just posted on Facebook Live about the Bull$&<at>& I just witnessed. Go check it out in my fan page. See y’all tomorrow on <at>FirstTake. Don’t you worry. I’m healthy again. See y’all tomorrow morning. I’ll be there"
"<at>EezyStyles STHU! There is no BOTH sides. Just because Bennett shouldn’t be instructing the media to get away from a grown player doesn’t mean he was wrong is pointing out fans shouldn’t have been throwing things at his teammate. Someone with a damn brain would understand that."

"And BTW......hey Mike Mitchell, where are you? Ya see why you don’t look ahead to the <at>Patriots??? Sh&$! Game might be over already. Damn!!!!"
"What in the hell are the <at>steelers doing?? Why are they running sweeps against a defense with this speed? You’re less than a yard away. How about a QB sneak? Or to LeVeon right up the middle? Damn!!"
"Why is Mike Mitchell even talking to Leonard Fournette. Better yet: why don’t the <at>Jaguars just give Fournette the ball? It’s not like the damn <at>steelers can stop him. I can’t believe how disappointing this is. I’m so disgusted."

"Okay! Okay! I like that TD to LeVeon from Big Ben. But it doesn’t mean a damn thing if the <at>steelers’ defense doesn’t figure out how to stop Fournette and the <at>Jaguars’ offense. What’s up Mike Mitchell? Let’s Go!"
"Yep. 28 of the <at>Jaguars’ 35 points came from their offense. But Mike Mitchell wants us to believe this defense is guaranteed to go to Foxborough and beat the <at>Patriots. #ChildPlease"
"Now <at>steelers’ D...whatcha gonna do? Man-The-Hell-Up! Stop somebody! Damn!!!!"
"This is officially embarrassing. The <at>steelers defense has given up 35 of 42 pts to a BLAKE BORTLES offense. You see why you needed to keep quiet <at>iammikemitchell? Even if you play well, you can’t speak for everybody. 35 Damn points! Boy do I long for the days of STEEL CURTAIN!"
"These <at>steelers. Can’t even do an on-side kick right. I personally had no problem with the attempt — even if you do have two timeouts left — but MY GOODNESS. Boswell can’t do an on-side kick right? Ridiculous."
"This was a disgraceful performance by the <at>steelers’ defense. They never - ever - showed up. And I’m driving this right in the lap of Mike Mitchell who, at least, APPEARED to look right past the <at>Jaguars. Trust is point to #’s all day but the <at>steelers haven’t had smite D in yrs"
"The <at>steelers totally looked past the <at>Jaguars. And the defense is responsible. Big Ben showed up, despite mistakes. <at>AB84 showed. <at>LeveonbeII showed up. But their defense didn’t. No Steel Curtain in the Steel City. That’s what happened."
"Great kick by Forbath. Kudos! But 1:29 is plenty of time for Drew Brees to get <at>Saints in FG Range. No.2 offense vs. No.1 Defense. Im<at>nervous but I believe in Brees!!!"
"Yeah! Like I said: I BELIEVE in Drew Brees. No matter what happens over these last 25 seconds, he did his job!!!!"

"We haven’t even had a chance to pass gas yet and already, Brady to Gronk for a TD. Two things: <at>HoustonTexans turnover on first snap inexcusable. But worse, Houston’s defense couldn’t do anything about it. Not good."
"Just watched ELI Manning throw same pass to Odell that he got hurt on last season. Made me nervous."
"Damn! Ryan Fitzpatrick to DeSean Jackson on a bomb for a TD. Jameis better be careful. Job might not be waiting for him once he gets back in this keeps up."
"Btw....helluva catch just made right now by Evan Engram. But a holding penalty brings it bavk"
"On another note, Stefan Diggs sold Richard Sherman on an up-field move, then came back. 19-yard gain. Looked entirely too easy. <at>Vikings not shy about attacking Sherman this far. #Hmmmmmm"
"Big Ben just intercepted by a ROOKIE, Denzel Ward. #F&<at>$"
"Here’s the deal with <at>saquon right now for the <at>Giants: too much damn  tap-dancing. That burst that, say, an <at>EzekielElliott Has is not what I’m seeing thus far. If you’re 233lbs with tree trunks for legs, why the hell do you need to do all that? Hit the hole and go!"
"Uh oh! <at>Mathieu_Era gets tipped interception at <at>Patriots 17-yard line. <at>HoustonTexans in good spot but Watson holding onto ball too long. Plus, at least 3 Texans already hurt in this game; precisely what plagued them last year. Something to watch"
"What the hell is going on with Tampa? Ryan Fitzpatrick just ran in for a TD. Bucs Up 14-10"
"Speaking of TD’s, perfect thrown from Kirk Cousins to Stefon Diggs. Absolutely perfect throw. This is why they guaranteed Cousins $84-mil. Let’s see if it continues"
"I can’t believe I’m saying this but Ryan Fitzpatrick is putting on a show. Is that him and tamp’s receivers? Or is the <at>Saints defense more suspect than we were willing to recognize? Let’s see"
"This <at>steelers offense is looking real suspect in my eyes. Just can’t seem to make anything happen."
"I take it back. James Conner busted WALKED in on a TD run. <at>steelers we’re helped by a roughing the passer penalty, but who gives a damn. I’ll take what I can get. Steelers Up 7-0"
"Patriots go up 14-3. Sick of us acting like there’s some suspense. Screens. Dips & Dunks. To Hogan. To Dorsett. To Gronk. It just doesn’t matter. They’re a well-oiled machine. They just get it done. And the <at>HoustonTexans offense hasn’t done a damn-impressive thing yet."
"DeShaun Watson: 8 drop backs. Sacked once and hurried 5 times."
"Nice throw just now from Watson to Jordan Thomas in 1-on-1 coverage. TE is a big boy. Watson should use him more."
"Another int by Big Ben. Looks like receiver ran wrong route, though. Still, this is what you get when you help run Todd Haley out if town. Too many times, folks act like we’ve got to have Thanksgiving Dinner together or exchange Christmas Gifts to work together. Just do the job!"
"Uh, Hello: Andrew Luck is balling. 14-for-19, 146 yards, 1 TD. He’s back"
"The <at>49ers are in a 1st & Goal situation due to yet another holding penalty vs <at>XavierRhodes29_ . He is BIGTIME, but that’s the one bad part about him that he’s got to fix."
"Doesn’t matter. <at>49ers 14-play drive gone because Alfred Morris gets stripped by Linval Joseph and the 1-yard line. <at>Vikings recover. Defense is still bigtime, showing why they were no.1 last season until the last 6-quarters we saw them in the playoffs."
"Damnit! <at>deshaunwatson just floats the ball into the end zone for an interception. What the hell us going on? Again, <at>HoustonTexans look lost offensively. <at>DeAndreHopkins is nowhere to be found thus far. We’ll see, but totally unimpressive this far"
"Btw.....Jags defense all over the <at>Giants. They can’t seem to do anything right now. ELI a virtual stationary target"
"Gotta admit, I like what I’m seeing from Kirk Cousins. But it IS the regular season, so I won’t sweat it too much"
"Wish I could say I like what I’m seeeing from Big Ben. Bad conditions, plus bad plays fro receivers. But still: Big Ven has 3 But’s in the first half. Not good. That’s just not good!"
"Btw......with the <at>Browns doing absolutely nothing offensively, it’ll be interesting to see if Hue Jackson just says “To Hell With It All” and elects to put in <at>bakermayfield and bench <at>TyrodTaylor. Im<at>not wishing that on Tyrod at all. Just pointing out that ya just never know!"
"WTH is is going on? Ryan Fitzpatrick has let the <at>Buccaneers to 31-First Half points. My goodness!"
"Great touch throw from Joe Flacco to Michael Crabtree, who tap danced in the back of the end zone. <at>Ravens look good, but it’s against the <at>buffalobills - who’s thrown their season but just won’t admit it to the rest of us. Anyone who starts Pederman is doing just that!#AwfulTeam"
"55 points in the scoreboard in the first half of <at>Buccaneers vs <at>Saints. Same ole Saints (No defense. Everything on Drew Brees’ Shoulders). Different Day"
"Manning just had <at>OBJ_3 open — had him matched up vs a safety. But ELI missed him, for the 2nd time today. This keeps up and it’ll be clear that Eli’s the one who has to get it together. Odell speed, etc. is there. Not on him."
"Btw.....Carlos Hyde is running the ball effectively vs <at>steelers, averaging better than 4-yds per carry. But guess what: so is 2nd-round pick, Nick Chubb. We’ll see how this works out."
"Awwwww Damn! <at>TyrodTaylor just rushes from about 20- yards out for a TD. <at>Browns rushed for about 70-damn yards on that drive. These damn Steelers are really annoying me right now."
"Another Fitzpatrick to Evans hookup. <at>Buccaneers down near <at>Saints 5-yard line. Just doing what they want offensively. Saints’ defense looking pathetic right now. Just pathetic."
"Uh Huh! Jimmy G just threw a Pick-6. Receiver DUD fall down, but the throw was getting intercepted anyone because it wasn’t near the receiver, period. I know <at>MollyQerim  won’t want to admit that about her 2nd favorite WB, but it’s absolutely true."
"There is a legitimate chance that this year’s <at>buffalobills may be the WORST NFL team we’ve seen this decade. Forget records (the 0-16teams in Detroit & CLEVELAND in recent memory. I’m not talking record. I’m just saying they are God-Awful. Is there any worse than Peterman?#Lordy"
"No surprises here: the pick-6 off a deflected pass by ELI Manning started with a tackle blowing by RT Erick Flowers. Good Lord! It just never ends with this guy"
"There is a caller into the Stephen A. Smith radio show named “Carlton,” based out of Tampa. There is no bigger fan of Ryan Fitzpatrick that I know of. I can only imagine how he’s feeling right now, with Bucs having now dropped 48pts on Saints — and counting. #LordHaveMercy!"
"Wow! <at>saquon just busted out the gates and ran for a 68-yard TD run. Before this moment, he was only averaging 2.3 yards per carry. Still, a question: he was clearly out of gas after the 68-yarder. So why the hell does Shurmur give the man the ball in the 2-pt conversion?#Idiotic"
"Garrappolo overthrows Kittle from<at>the inside slot. He was open. He missed it. He may be good. This is the <at>Vikings defense. But like I said: he’s no Tom Brady. Let the man prove something first place. Thank you very mich"
"Ummm, something necessary to point out: <at>OBJ_3 has 11 receptions today. 11. I know <at>jalenramsey didn’t say anything about Beckham, but he did say something about the person throwing him the ball: ELI. Still love Ramsey though. Brother is special."
"Botched handle on punt by some dude named Clay finishes off <at>Giants"
"Jimmy Garrappolo gets ball with over a minute and a half left, with a chance to tie, then proceeds to throw the ball RIGHT INTO COVERAGE to Smith for the int. His 3rd INT in the day. Need I say anymore?
He can play. I’m wishing him luck. But I tried to tell y’all: not yet!"
"It’s only his 8th-career start. Shame on all those who tried to act like he’s the <url>ing if Brady. Pump the damn brakes."
"Suttton intercepts <at>TyrodTaylor, making up for the touchdown he gave up to Josh Gordon earlier. Btw.....happy as hell to see Gordon catch that TD. So special. Wishing him all the luck. But the <at>steelers had better not lose this game. It’s embarrassing enough GM is in OT."
"Awwww S<at>&$! <at>Chiefs looking prophetic in their praise for <at>PatrickMahomes5. He just connected on a 58-yarder to Tyreek Hill off a slant pattern. Chiefs up 14-3."
"The <at>Browns just got a sack. Are the <at>steelers offensive line going to blame <at>LeVeonBell for that too?? Next point in OT wins this game. Why do I suspect the <at>steelers is going to blow this? If they do, I’ll be looking for my man Ryan Clark tomorrow on <at>FirstTake"
"Gotta say: this kid <at>denzelward has been BALLIN for the <at>Browns all afternoon. I’m thoroughly impressed with this kid. Maybe we should stop talking if waiting for <at>bakermayfield and start paying more attention to this rookie."
"Yep! <at>Earl_Thomas misses all of training camp, practices less than a week, yet steps right in, reads Case Keenum like a book for the int, and sets up <at>Seahawks First TD."
"After that magnificent running from Cam Newton, the drive gets ruined near the goal line because Christian McCaffrey gets stripped. <at>dallascowboys ball."
"Just need to Big Ben hit from behind. Another int. <at>Browns kick FG to win the damn game. I’m sick to my stomach. If the lose this game, it’ll be their largest blown 4th-QT lead in a loss in team history."
"FG blocked. Scored tied with :13 left. I freakin HATE TIES. Play until you drop damnit. Can’t stand this. This is a rule the NFL needs to change. Who gives a damn about a tie? No winners or losers! Sunday afternoon in Cleveland and Pitssburgh just wasted."
"Tyrell WILLIAMS just dropped a wide-open TD pass from Phillip Rivers. He may be some practice squad success story, but if he doesn’t make it for that....that’s exactly where he’ll find himself back to. He’s better hope Rivers throws him the ball again."
"The <at>Panthers have had heat in <at>dak all afternoon. Don’t know why Garrett decides to go for it on 4th & 10...having one of the best punters, plus timeouts. But then again, what do I care. It’s the damn <at>dallascowboys we’re talking about here. Haaaaaaaa!!!!!!!"
"Yep! <at>Panthers did it again. See, this is what we were <url>ing into the season: can Dan really handle it when it’s on his shoulders? So far — dating back to last season AND this one — the answer is NO!!!! Hey y’all: How ‘Bout Dem Cowboys!” Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"No place for <at>dak to throw. No place for <at>EzekielElliott to run. And remember folks, I’m being very nice. I didn’t say a word about Randy Gregory😀😀😀😀😀😀😀"
"By the way.....it’s just one week. But I’m willing to go so far as to call <at>Chiefs all-purpose star, Tyreek Hill, THE MOST EXPLOSIVE player in the NFL. He’s THAT soecial"
"Man, I can’t wait to address this subject on First Take tomorrow. What are y’all thoughts? <url>"
"Talking Le'Veon TOMORROW! Was that game further evidence that the Steelers should descend upon Bell and BEG him <url>e back now? Check out First Take tomorrow when we discuss! <url>"
"I’m not laughing when I ask that. Seriously! <url>"
"I’d love to tell you <at>AaronRodgers12 is a baaaaadddddddddd man and that’s that! But that was just a huge lapse on the back-end of <at>ChicagoBears defense. Major collapse. But now let’s see what <at>Mtrubisky10 does. We’re about to find out."
"Public service announcement. <url>"

"Somebody had to say it. <url>"
"🎧<at>ESPNBooger joins to recap yesterday's NFL action before he calls tonight's Monday Night game. <url>"
"Good Lord! The very first play of Sam Darnold’s career, he throws a puck-6 to Diggs. Why the hell are you throwing an ACROSS-THE-FIELD PASS? Jesus! This ain’t USC! Actually, maybe he still thinks it is. Lions 7, Jets 0. #MyGoodness"
"Good drive by <at>nyjets. Good throws from Darnold, good runs by Powell and Crowell. If Jets keep this power game going, who knows. Let’s find out what the <at>Lions under Matt Patricia are made of."
"What did y’all just see: Morris Claiborne leap and intercept Matthew Stafford? Or Stafford — one of the highest paid players in the league - reminding you, yet again, that he’s never won a playoff game in his decade-long career?"
"Sam Darnold did go to college for a couple of years, right? How difficult is it <url>prehend that you don’t take sacks in the red zone? This is the second tome he’s done it this gane"
"BIGTIME throw by Darnold. He’s 4-for-4 on 3rd Downs. Whoa! Very impressive. Unless you want to look at Patricia and say: yet another Belichick coordinator who won’t pan out"
"Another interception by Matthew Stafford. His 3rd. This time a pick-6. Awful! At some point we’ve got to ask ourselves why in the hell is a QB that’s never win a playoff game getting paid more than $27-mil per. I guess the answer would be: Be a use Kirk Cousins is making $28 mil"
"ANOTHER damn interception. What a God-Awful performance by Stafford. Matt Patricia has to be saying: “I can’t believe I left Tom Brady for this.” He <url>pletely shook and I don’t blame him. <at>nyjets LB’s are just laying back in coverage, daring Stafford to throw.#Embarrassing"
"This is the kind of performance that should make ALL NFL teams pause at the thought of hiring a Belichick disciple! Patricia’s very first game and this is how they look."
"Gotta admit, that drive by the <at>Raiders was special, especially that finish by Beastmode and that offensive line. That’s the way you start out a new era. That score personifies Gruden. Gotta give credit where is due. Now let’s see how this <at>Raiders Defense does!"

"Hey! <at>GGG round 1 because if his jab. <at>Canelo gets round 2 because of power shots, speed, and the swelling developing in <at>GGG left side of face because of it"
"2-2 after 4. Gave 3rd round to Canelo and 4th to GGG. Jabs. A couple of body shots. And finally pushed Canelo back"
"Yep! <at>GGG gets Round 5. Using jab. <at>Canelo stalking but not connecting. He’s better when he’s countering. Not attacking. At least not yet"
"That’s 3  rounds to 2 for <at>GGGBoxing"
"Round 6 was even. Both got off decent shots. I still say: <at>Canelo is hurting himself by backing up. He’s at his best countering. Not being the aggressor"
"I see what <at>Canelo is doing though. <at>GGG is the older man. Attack the body and hope he wears down"
"I gave <at>Canelo round 7. Power shots early propelled him. But <at>GGG is using that jab. <at>Caneko is trying to do what <at>FloydMayweather did to <at>TheNotoriousMMA: walk him down. Stay in his chest. Take leverage off those shots"
"I give Round 8 to <at>GGG. Less power shots but more jabs and solid shots connected. <at>Canelo cut over left eye. But <at>GGG looks tired"
"I gave <at>Canelo Round 9. Power shots connected. <at>GGG <url>ing. When he uses the jab he’s very effective and <at>Canelo struggles. But other wise <at>Canelo has advabtage"
"Round 10 goes to <at>GGG. Hurt <at>Canelo with right, then a flurry. <at>Canelo started off round strong but faded too much. Now he might be getting tired. Lighter weight costing him????"
"Round 11 belonged to <at>GGG. <at>Canelo came on a kittle late in the round but <at>GGG accumulated punches. If <at>GGG uses his jab, he wins the fight"
"Folks, I know it was close and that <at>Canelo was the constant aggressor. I also predicted <at>Canelo would win by decision. But I had <at>GGGBoxing winning this fight by 1 round"

"Didn’t folks walk into this game believing <at>UMichFootball’s defense was the truth?? Yet, here they are having given up 41 of the 48 points <at>OhioStateFB has scored on them. Worse loss of Harbaugh’s collegiate career. I’m turning off the TV."
"The wheels have <url>e off: THE <at>OhioStateFB is RUNNING UP THE DAMN SCORE on <at>UMichFootball. Michigan should be ashamed of itself. I don’t care how good OSU is, there is no excuse for this to happen. Should be tough for Harbaugh to show his face for a long time."
"Hey <at>finebaum, no need to apologize any longer about getting on Harbaugh. After this embarrassing defensive performance by <at>UMichFootball, I can’t utter a word in his defense. What a disgusting defensive performance. Worse loss of Harbaugh’s career? I think so"

"I gave Fury that first round. Made a wild Wilder miss. Used his jab. Again, Wilder too wild. Needs to calm down and use his jab....set up the right"
"I gave Wilder Round 2 because of a couple of power punches, but still don’t like what I’m seeing. Fury is moving well and using his jab. Wilder’s jab could be sharper. He’s gone away from the body already and is head-hunting"
"I gave round 3 to Fury. Caught Wilder twice, plus is just doing a better job of boxing — hitting, moving while using his jab. Fury up 2 rounds to 1."
"Round 4 to Wilder. But Fury is still making him miss all night with that right. Except this time Fury didn’t connect on anything either. Fury is clearly the better boxer thus far. Just didn’t throw enough punches that round."
"Again, Wilder missing more than connecting. Can buy a right-connect, or a left-hook or haymaker, for that matter. But I still give him the edge because of activity. Fury’s just evading moreso than fighting."
"Fury gets round 6. Here’s the problem: Wilder has got to get on the inside. Fury <url>fortable standing outside and pity-patting him to death. And Wilder is throwing <url>binations. He hasn’t caught Fury with a power punch in the last 3 rounds. It’s like he’s waiting 4 R-Hand."
"Fury again. He’s winning this fight right now. Wilder relying on big shots, but can’t connect on any of them. He’s getting outboxed, plain and simple. Plus, his left eye is swelling up. Fury is doing precisely what he came on <at>FirstTake and told me he’d do."
"Wilder connected late with a rare power shot but still lost the round. Fury actually looks fresher at this point, too."
"Fury goes down in the 9th. Wilder gets the round 10-8, but if you can believe it Fury gets up and looks fresher than Wilder. Stunned Wilder with <url>ing in and that paused everything. Wilder looks exhausted."
"Fury wins Round 10. Boxed, moved. Wilder barely threw a punch until the round was over. Wilder has to win 11 & 12th to win this fight"
"Fury again. Just out-Boxing Wilder. Jabs and sharp punches. Wilder answers by punching air. Can’t find Fury. Needs KO to win."
"Ref helped Fury survive in the end. Fight should’ve been stopped in 10 sec. but since it finished, despite the 2-point round, Fury wins by a point — despite getting dropped twice."
"What a great, great call by Nagy for the <at>ChicagoBears to tie the game at the end of regulation. <url>e back from a 10-point deficit with less than 90 sec left. <at>obj didn’t go after on-side kick and <at>Giants defense didn’t get stops. Just encapsulates their whole season.#Mess"

"The <at>Buccaneers are just ridiculous. Talking about finding ways to beat yourself. As awful as this defense has been this year, they showed up today. But there’s a fumble by Winston, another on a handoff. Of all the days for to offense to NOT hold up it’s end of the bargain!#Shit!"
"That is some straight BULLSHIT!!!!! Too late on the pass interference call. Questionable, too. I swear these damn refs make me sick. They’re trying to rob my <at>steelers.#Damn! Damn!Damn!"
"Straight B.S. but that’s ok. <at>steelers now have enough time. A FG to tie or a TD to win. Go for the damn win. I would’ve let them score once they were at the1-yard line anyways. Now Big Ben, handle your damn business. Still mad about fake FG attempt though."
"Shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"If there's a time I hope <at>KingJames is watching <at>FirstTake, let it be right now. <url>"
"Also, watch the FULL conversation here: <url>"
"Ho Ho Ho!
(credit: <at>hasunow) <url>"
"It’s just 1 game. A regular-season game at that. But it’s important to say: The <at>Lakers are WAXING the <at>Warriors. I mean kicking their you-know-what. WithOUT <at>KingJames in the floor, and against <at>KDTrey5, <at>StephenCurry30 who are playing.#Damn!"
"Thank you <at>UPROXX for spending the day with me. Check out the piece! <url>"
"Oh Hell No! I do not want to hear this about John Wall. Look, I’m not about to question the legitimacy of his left heel injury. Hell, I won’t even question that it might be best he have season-ending surgery. But where was this when he dropped 40 on the Lakers? Why now...."
"All these damn players want to get paid like they’re shining but where’s the shine? Against the Cavs? Against the Nets? Against the freakin Atlanta Hawks, for crying out loud??? 
Y’all can go ahead and join hands in prayer that Wall gets better, 100% healthy."
"But I’m hoping for more than that. I’m hoping this brother returns IN SHAPE, ready to validate that $170 mil he’s about to get over the next 4 seasons......instead of leaving us wondering if he’s calling it a season because he ain’t about to make an All-Star team..."
"....with the Wizards looking like trash half the time? Is the pressure too much???
See why we should love LeBron James? No matter what, he shows up. Each and every single season! In Shape! Ready to perform! Getting paid mega-dough but playing like he’s broke."
".....and the Wizards damn-sure ain’t making the playoffs. That’s my two cents. Bye! I’m heading back on my vacation. #CantBelieveThis"
"Haaaaaaa <url>"
"Hey <at>ChaseHughesNBCS, just saw your tweet regarding <at>JohnWall. Quote this: I don’t want to hear a damn thing from Wall about talking to him man-to-man. I showed at one game and waited for him in the locker room; he <url>e out. I showed up again when they played <at>celtics"
"And <at>JohnWall still didn’t want to talk, <at>ChaseHughesNBCS. I’ve said nothing to take back and I damn sure don’t hide from anyone. What I said about Wall not being in great shape and struggling periodically was FACT. His appearance at the Rose Bar was courtesy of TMZ, not me!"
"And as for my questioning the timing of <at>JohnWall possibly having surgery, that’s what we feel as fans from witnessing what’s unfolded over this season. Wall knows me. Rich Paul knows me. And there isn’t a soul in sports who doesn’t know how to find me. Any time <at>ChaseHughesNBCS"
"So the next time <at>JohnWall or any player tells you they are looking for me for a man to-man convo, <at>ChaseHughesNBCS, tell them to name the time and place and I’ll show up. I’d <url>e it...even on my damn vacation. I’m not the one hiding. Never have! Never will!"
"<at>JohnWall <at>ChaseHughesNBCS <at>celtics Not true! <url>"
"Okay fellas! Okay! <at>damienwoody (With your no-tie-wearing self), with Spears and R-Jefferson(being contaminated by Woody) still doesn’t take away from the fact that I’m proud right now watching <at>FirstTake. Very proud fellas. Keep doing it. I’ll be back tomorrow. U hear me Woody😀"
"I’m going to give this much to my man, <at>damienwoody, filling in on <at>FirstTake today: at least he knew better than sitting in MY CHAIR without a damn tie on. He knows better, so I’ll give him credit for that much.#BeRESPECTFUL!"
"Well Congrats coach Blatt. You really stepped out there with that take. So I’m “clueless” because I believed the Phoenix Suns should take a 7’1” talent from right up the road for a 19-year-old talent I acknowledged having never seen? Okay! I’ll take the jab. But with a question:"
"Are you willing to call your friends with the Kings clueless for taking Bagley at No. 2 instead of Doncic? Good to hear from you sir!"
"It’s great to be back off vacation. Time to wreak havoc. <at>FirstTake in the <url>ing at you......NOW!!!!!!"

"I unload on the NFL coach firings.

Listen to the Stephen A. Smith After Dark podcast: <url> <url>"
"Wow! What a game. <at>JHarden13 is simply sensational, but <at>clintcapela15 is balling, too. <at>KDTrey5 is balling but missed 2 contested shots late. It’s OT. Harden keeps playing this way and he’ll win MVP again."
"Yo Iguodala, <at>JHarden13 ain’t the guy you try to flop against. Because if you don’t get the call — which you likely won’t — that’s more space for him to drill a 3.....which he did."
"Everyone has mad respect for the <at>warriors. But I don’t see the FEAR that once existed. Without that intimidation factor, things could get really interesting once the playoffs begin"
"The <at>HoustonRockets got hosed on the play. <at>KDTrey5 had both feet out of bounds and in the yellow. Couldn’t be more out of bounds on that save. Refs missed it. <at>StephenCurry30 hits jumper to put <at>warriors up 134-132. Could cost  them game"
"OMG!!! OMG!!!  <at>JHarden13 pulls up for big-time 3 on both <at>KlayThompson & <at>Money23Green with 1-Second left in OT. He has 44pts, ladies & gentleman. The Best scorer in the game, the reigning MVP, just won the game......putting on a show. This brother is unreal, and special."
"Some of the patterns that I've noticed in the NFL hiring process have inspired me to look into a career change.

Listen to the Stephen A. Smith After Dark podcast: <url>"
"There’s more to all of these coaching dismissals than meets the eye.....and I’m pissed off folks ain’t talking more about it. <url>"
"Who remembers this?!?! I DO 😀 <url>"
"Just like Kawhi had the right to leave San Antonio, the fans had the right to boo him. <url>"

"Damn! Pretty hard to watch that injury to the <at>dallascowboys WR Allen Hurns. Don’t wish that on anyone. God Bless that brother, wishing him a full recovery. Damn!"
"It’s obvious: <at>Seahawks offense stinks. They can’t do anything right tonight. <at>dallascowboys got this game. Oh well! Gotta wait for the <at>Saints to avenge their loss weeks ago and blow them out."
"OMG!!!!! What stupidity. Didn’t even give the <at>Seahawks a chance for the on-side kick. I don’t eve. Understand how a kicker — even one filling in — could be that idiotic."
"I’m excited for my man <at>DrStevePerry and his new daytime show “#Breakthrough with Dr. Steve Perry.” Make sure you check it out on <at>FOXTV. It’s a new year, new you so LA, NY, Phoenix, Houston, Orlando, ATL, Detroit & Charlotte get your #Breakthrough from Jan 7-18th."
"It’s not like I’m claiming Foles doesn’t deserve ANY credit, <url>e on! That <at>Eagles defense stepped up BIGTIME. <url>"
"You already know I'm ready for the #NationalChampionship. #ESPNRadio #ESPNews <url> <url>"
"Don't get me wrong, Nick Foles played well. But that Eagles DEFENSE was special. <url>"
"YES. Devoid of hindsight — strictly in that moment — The Ravens should have BENCHED Lamar Jackson after how he was playing. <url>"
"Stephen A. Smith After Dark Podcast: I talk to <at>finebaum about tonight's National Championship game and whether or not Nick Saban would give the NFL another shot. <url> <url>"
"Now THAT’s BIGTIME! Right after TUA throws a pick-six — acknowledging to his teammates it was HIS FAULT, what does he <url>es right back on the very next off. Possession and throws a bomb for a TD. Just like that!!!!"
"I can’t believe what the hell im seeing. I never, in my wildest dreams, believed I’d see <at>AlabamaFTBL defense look like this, not TUA throwing 2 INT’s. What the hell is going on here, <at>finebaum? What is going on?"
"Jesus! <at>Alabama looks as if they’re about to get blown out. <at>ClemsonFB  is all over them!"
"This is absolutely unreal. I cannot believe what I’m witnessing <at>ClemsonFB do to <at>AlabamaFTBL. I have never seen a Nick Saban team get beat like this. This is pure domination."
"Great catch by Ross.  Saban <url>pletely shell-shocked....like there is absolutely nothing that he can do about this <url>ing <at>AlabamaFTBL way, courtesy of <at>ClemsonFB. This is unreal. No one saw THIS beat <url>ing!"
"Personal Congrats to Dabo Swinney! What an absolute spectacular performance by <at>ClemsonFB. I’m <url>pletely done doubting this man. He coached like he wanted <at>AlabamaFTBL....like he was waiting for them all year long. Just spectacular. I’m never doubting this man again."

"You’re absolutely right Mr. James. So when are you going to tell the World you’d LOVE for Klay to be a Laker? Without getting fined for tampering, of course. <url>"
"<at>AZCardinals I don’t care how many mistakes I’ve made in my 25 years in this business, I can assure you it falls short of the moribund product you guys contaminated the state of Arizona with over the previous 4 months..."

"Antonio Brown doesn’t have to EAT Thanksgiving Dinner with YOU. He just NEEDS to play. FIGURE IT OUT! <url>"
"Oh, you’ve misread, my brother. I was simply acknowledging that from a talent perspective, the <at>dallascowboys should be legitimate favorites to win this game. But there’s no way in HELL im picking them to win any postseason game. No need to worry about that. <url>"
"The <at>RamsNFL are really ticking me off right now very predictable. Too many running plays. No play-action utilizing Gurley or anyone else. This is playing right into the <at>dallascowboys hands. And I haven’t even begun to talk about how LA’s defense is looking."
"Haaaaaaaaa! I’m sooooo sorry I have to say this, but it’s a necessary message for the FANS....not the team that did have a good season: How ‘Bout Dem <at>dallascowboys! Haaaaaaaaaaaa! Take y’all asses HOME, Cowboys fans"
"Hey <at>michaelirvin88, how are ya this morning? Haaaaaaa!!!!!! I’d love to have a talk with you soon. Ya know, like a history lesson, sort of speak. A discussion about MY HISTORY regarding your <at>dallascowboys, not THE HISTORY like you brought up on <at>FirstTake. Haaaaaaa!"
"My SINCERE condolences to each and every one of you Cowboy fans! SIKE!!!! Aaaaahhhhhhh Haaaaaa! <url>"
"This <at>Chargers defense is getting embarrassed and picked apart. Brady is picking these boys apart. This looks like a route in the making."
"An annihilation taking place before our very eyes. A straight route. 4 possessions for <at>Patriots=4 TD’s. Why in the hell did I ever believe in these <at>Chargers. So pathetic. At least give us a game.#Jeez"
"And how many times are the <at>Chargers gonna find themselves in 3rd-and-long situations? I mean, do something on the first 2 downs of a drive."
"The <at>Patriots are hitting Ohillip Rivers at every turn. Flowers is bulldozing through <at>Chargers off. Line. Plus, Rivers arm doesn’t appear strong enough to make accurate throws outside the numbers down field. It’s just all falling apart before our very eues"
"Rough day for King. Getting burned in coverage. Getting penalized. And now fumbling a punt return. <at>Patriots about to close these boys out, barring a miracle. What a disgraceful performance by the <at>Chargers."
"The GREAT Jim Nance just brought up the <at>Chargers traveling back from Baltimore, then back to New England. But I agree with Romo: the <at>Patriots are just physically abusing these boys. Should’ve stuck to my guns: Cali team too soft for cold <url>e playoff time.#GameOver"
"Who’s the <at>Chargers defensive coordinator? Gus Bradley? Boy does he have some explaining to do. Then again, the <at>Patriots have 5 TD’s. The <at>Chargers have 5 first downs. That’s just pure domination = Belichick over 2-year coach Anthony Lynn."
"Btw.....this is really not on Phillip Rivers. He’s not getting ANY protection. Off. Line are missing blocked left and right. The <at>Chargers are looking like we suspected. Looks like a lot of us got hoodwinked. A miracle now qualifies as the game simply <url>petitive.#Damn"

"Congrats to <at>RamsNFL. Coach McVay is a helluvs coach. Their defense played well too. But the <at>Saints were robbed in that non-pass interference call. That was ridiculous. Shouldn’t have been an OT. No matter, if it’s the <at>RamsNFL vs <at>Chiefs I’m lovin’ that."
"I would love for the <at>Chiefs to win this game. But I will say this: they’re very lucky this is only 7-0. They’ve been thoroughly outclassed this far. Halfway thru 2nd QT: they’ve only run 8 plays. Have minute-2 yards. Haven’t gotten past their own 30-yard line. Damn!"
"What a B.S. call. That was not a roughing-the-passer call. Jones did not touch Brady in the helmet/face. Bogus."
"Even I’ve got to admit Travis Kelce should be thanking his lucky stars for that penalty vs New England. That was a fumble in the <at>Patriots favor."

"This <at>Chiefs defense looks absolutely petrified. They literally look scared to rush Brady right now. At least try and get in his face. They’re not even doing that right now. They know who they’re dealing with.#ScaredToDeath!"

"I’m sick over this. For myself! For fight fans. And especially for Deontay Wilder — who should’ve been the one administering this TKO. I’m so freakin disgusted right now!"
"I watched the fight 3x. Look, Ruiz is good. Solid boxer. Fast hands. But everyone’s missing the point: THE FIGHT we were all waiting for — Wilder vs. Joshua — is officially ruined. No one with sense believes Joshua has a chance vs him now, even if he goes back and beats Ruiz."
"He’s got a glass jaw. That is the point. Mega fight = Ruined. That is my damn point, ppl. Wake up!"

By no means did I insult your career. Never even questioned it. In fact, I specifically recall acknowledging that you’re pretty damn good."
"<at>Andy_destroyer1 What I questioned was A.) How you looked physically (all due respect.....as has everyone else) and the fact that a megafight was ruined because Anthony Joshua got his butt whipped by you. A Megafight isn’t just about the fighters themselves, but who people are actually salivating"
"<at>Andy_destroyer1 .....to see. Fair or unfair, the public was clamoring for Wilder vs. Joshua. That is not a knock against you. You’ve proven your worth and your time has arrived. But it came at the expense of a megafight that is no more. That is what I was saying. That it what I was decrying. And"
"<at>Andy_destroyer1 <url>pletely stand by that. You are to be respected for your skills. You’re damn good and you deserve our praise and respect. But Joshua <url>pletely outclassed by you is the latest reminder of how Boxibg repeatedly cheats us all by not giving us the fights we want WHEN...."
"<at>Andy_destroyer1 We want them. If that is your definition of disrespect <at>Andy_destroyer1, I am sorry to inform you there is nothing I can do for you. Congratulations to you and mad respect.

"Ok fine I’ll do it. <url>"
"Congratulations <at>Canelo. Your tweet at me may be one of the most ignorant tweets I’ve ever received. Once again, I have no issue with <at>Andy_destroyer1. Congrats to him. My issue was with boxing fans being made to WAIT, the ultimately robbed of our interest in Wilder vs. Joshua..."
"Because the loss robbed us of the magnitude a MEGAFIGHT gives us <at>Canelo. How do YOU of all ppl not know that? You gave us you vs GGG. You didn’t make us wait. So this isn’t about knowing boxing. This is about Boxing continuing to rob us of the fights we want WHEN we want them."

"Damn! What a shocker that game was. Gotta point to Nick Nurse on that one! <url>"
"KD getting hurt there might have been one of the most depressing moments I’ve experienced covering basketball. <url>"
"Damn! It’s over! It’s all over folks. <at>KDTrey5 goes down with 9:46 left in the half. Had 11 points. Ballin! <at>Warriors in control, and he goes down. Possibly his Achilles this time! Damn! Damn! Damn! Hard to see the <at>Raptors not winning now. What a shame!"
"Pay no attention to folks who think that way. They don’t know basketball. All the best to you and KD, wishing him a speedy recovery. <url>"

"The <at>Raptors are up 43-38. And right now, Lowry just looks absolutely exceptional. Making 3’s. Running the office. Moving the BBall. Siakam & Van Vleet are making shots, too. The <at>warriors will not win this game unless the figure out Lowry."
"Yes! <at>KlayThompson was suppose to be done. But then he wasn’t. Carried off the court one minute, ran right out the next. He said: “Hell No! I’m not going out like this!” <url>"

"I gave <at>MannyPacquiao the 7th because of that late charge and have him ahead 5 rounds to 2. But Thurman has been most effective when he’s moving and making Pacman chase."

"I’ve got <at>MannyPacquiao winning this fight 8 rounds to 4. 116-112"
"Should not have even been a split decision. <at>MannyPacquiao outclassed him most of the fight, period. Wasn’t even close. At least the final decision was the right now. But if Pacman knows what’s good for him, he’ll stay away from <at>terencecrawford  and <at>ErrolSpenceJr. I know THAT!"

"Thanks bro. Can't call out ignorance if you never allow it to be displayed. <url>"
"Green Bay without Aaron Rodgers is just some DAMN place with CHEESE! <url>"
"Yep! Because you’re being emotional for your 15 min. But you’re not thinking of the collateral damage. Of course we all should speak out. But there’s a time, place - and way — for everything. Especially when you’re US! <url>"

"Here's what I'm saying about Jay-Z partnering with the NFL... <url>"
"Fair enough <at>E_Reid35. But you weren’t advocating for him to keep it either. You were advocating for something far greater than that — something that transcends you and Kap — which is why you both deserve our profound respect & gratitude. But how about seeing what Jay does 1st! <url>"
"......before condemning the man? Kap said he wanted action. You co-signed that. So let’s see what he actually does. You basically calling him a sellout is low. There’s more than 1 way to skin a cat. You way warrants respect. But it ain’t the ONLY. Think about that please. <url>"
"Sorry folks. Not taking the bait. While I believe <at>E_Reid35 could handle certain situations better (I.e. Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z), I will never disrespect this man. He’s fighting for US. I can disagree with his approach and still maintain Profound Respect for him, which I do. <url>"
"He is more than entitled to call my position ludicrous. <at>E_Reid35 has earned the right to do that. He’s good with me. I have no idea how he feels about me. Nor do I care. But I respect him and what he’s trying to do for US. Period! <url>"
"True! But I’m working on it :-) <url>"
"Guess who’s subbing for <at>MollyQerim today, filling in as Host on <at>FirstTake this morning: the WONDERFUL <at>ROSGO21. Tune in at the top of the hour. And YES! We’re finally back in ESPN for the full 2 hours"

"Y’all go right ahead and applaud Josh Gordon all you want. I’ll pray for the brother. But I’m not going that far: <url>"
"I have no doubt. But I’ve got some news for the Gauff’s: Coco won’t be the only one. They’ll be a significant part of history, too. What an absolutely beautiful family they are. And what a magnificent job they’re doing as parents. Kudos to the whole family. <url>"

"Here's the story of my first ever audition for ESPN, as I told <at>RealMichaelKay. <url>"
"<at>RealMichaelKay This has always been my mentality. <url>"
"I’ve already invaded Dallas and I can’t wait for Friday 😀 <url>"
"You don’t have a choice. Not if you’re watching sports. Get use to it <url>"
"Haaa. Not my fault. I’m in a Newspsper building. Not a TV studio. Can’t control  the lighting. <url>"
"Suck it up <url>"
"Thanks bro <url>"
"Damn right <url>"
"Haaaa <url>"
"I actually agree with you at this point <url>"
"That’s my brother right there. Love that dude. He’s always <url>ed <url>"
"Not at all. Summer’s are slow, so that’s the time to take off. I won’t be off for a while now. I’m back in full effect <url>"
"You know it <url>"
"And then some :-) <url>"
"Vacation in Europe <url>"
"I’m in town right now bro <url>"
"I picked the Bears <url>"
"Thank you so much <url>"
"So turn the channel and lose out <url>"
"Damn Right <url>"
"Friday <url>"
"Nope <url>"
"I AM back <url>"
"Thank you <url>"
"Don’t have to. The <url>es to me <url>"
"Please <url>"
"Yes Sir <url>"
"Blessings bro <url>"
"Get drug tested immediately please <url>"
"Thank you sir. Much appreciated <url>"
"As I said earlier on <at>FirstTake, Antonio Brown has brought this on himself. All this noise is utterly ridiculous! <url>"
"Haaaaa! That must mean the brother is looking smooth :-) <url>"
"I figured: why wait to annoy Dallas Cowboys fans when I could start right now. <url>"
"I’m baaaaaaack <url>"
"Me years ago. RJ now. Who did it better? <url>"
"Bottom line: Jon Gruden looks weak as hell w/ this call. A 1-game suspension secures Raiders having freedom to cut ties w/ AB in event he continues to engage in insubordination — assuming reports are true — and you give that up??? That is just PATHETIC. Gruden will regret this."
"Boy I hope I’m wrong, but I can’t see it."
"Top 5 reasons the Cowboys ain’t winning the Super Bowl! <url>"
"The Biggest Crow I’ve ever eaten in my career at ESPN! <url>"
"<at>Raiders Right decision. You cannot act this way and get away with it. Maybe my man Max is right. Maybe there really is something wrong. AB fought all this time to make this money, then just threw it all away before playing a single game. Disgraceful."
"<at>Raiders He’s too great not to land with another team if he wants to. But his days of getting his money has <url>e to an end.#SoSad"
"Some folks are some damn fools! Y’all go ahead and applaud AB all y’all want. After chasing all that money, w/ security, he’s now playing ONE YEAR AT A TIME. Period. Don’t get me started. Man, I can’t wait for <at>FirstTake on Monday. <url>"
"That was just a damn-good TD pass from Foles. The <at>Jaguars didn’t see that in years with Blake Bortles as their  QB. This is what they paid Foles for. We’ll see if it continues."
"OMG. Lamar Jackson just connected with Brown on an 83-yard bomb for a TD. Perfect throw from Lamar. And this kid, Brown: a rookie. First 2 catches of NFL career=Both TD. Young brother is putting on a show. Horrible start for <at>MiamiDolphins, down 21-0 to <at>Ravens."
"MaHomes to Watkins on a drag route = 49-yard TD connection. Too many plays thus far where <at>chiefs receivers are wide open. Not the Jacksonville defense I expected. Oh, Btw, Nick Foles our for rest of game w/ shoulder injury on that TD throw. Damn!"
"Peeps, maybe it’s just that the <at>MiamiDolphins defense is just this bad. But y’all need to know: <at>Lj_era8 is putting on a damn show for the <at>Ravens. His throws are right on target. He’s flinging this football all over the field. If he runs & throws, God help rest of the NFL."
"Nice move by my man <at>tkelce for a 41-yard hookup from <at>PatrickMahomes. Again, Jags far less impressive than I expected. I know the <at>Chiefs offense is a juggernaut, but still. Btw.....MaHomes is now being helped off field. He’s limping"
"Also, one big surprise, another not so big: A.) <at>Redskins are kicking the <at>Eagles butt right in Philadelphia, 17-0. B.) No surprise at all that the Rams are all over Cam Newton. They’re only up 10-0, but Csm has been over-throwing or under-throwing in the 1st Half=No Surprise!"
"Just a disgraceful performance by the <at>MiamiDolphins. They’re down 42-3 BEFORE the half — at HOME — but that’s not the only reason. They are dropping passes left & right. Missing tackles, etc. Flores has his work cut out for him. Just a horrible performance."
"Okay <at>K1, I see you. I see you. 18 pets in the 4th QT for the <at>AZCardinals. Scored tied at 24 with seconds left. OT is about to arrive."
"Or maybe not. Matthew Stanford is good <url>ebacks during the regular season."
"Damn! Damn! Damn! You Big Ben, can you figure out a way to beat Brady is Foxboro ONE DAMN TIME! F$&<at>&)$&<at><at>&$!!!!!!"
"I've never seen selfishness like this. I just don’t want to hear a different opinion on this: <url>"

"<url>e to AMERICA!!!!! <url>"
"Loved hanging out with The <at>breakfastclubam. Appreciate their question about how I got started. <url>"
"Ain’t about being done tough guy bro. I simply pointed out how I though you were playing around a couple of years ago, and then YOU publicly stated what your real intent was AFTERWARD to someone in the media. So I said, had I known...it wouldn’t have gone down like that. Period! <url>"
"Nobody has any right to put there hands on someone. I’d like to believe you know that. I respect you — and your fam — as well as your right to not like me, etc. But putting your hands and someone, then claiming you actually wished harm, is different. So based on that I meant... <url>"
"What I said and I still mean it. If anyone puts their hands on you and talks Sh&$<at>, what would you say or <url>e on bro? I’ve got respect for you and your bro — like I said — but you know you had no business doing that......if you weren’t playing around. I thought you were! <url>"
"Now I know! <url>"
"Yes <at>cthagod asked me about my DAMN hairline! And he’s right: I just might need to let it all go :-) <url>"
"I’m not selling out. I’m looking out. <url>"
"I always do. You do the same bro. I’m not hiding. I’ve done nothing but show you and your brother the utmost respect. Always. And I’ve called it like I’ve seen it. You make sure you do the same and there won’t be any issues this way. <url>"
"Another clownish diatribe from Antonio Brown. But I’d still PLAY him....for now <url>"
"I saw this book title and couldn’t help but laugh and sympathize with the author, aka <at>RealSkipBayless’ wife. Y’all go check out the book! <url>"
"Coming soon... <at>boardroom. You will really need to buckle up for this one. <url>"

"I am having a VERY BAD DAY <url>"
"As far as I'm concerned, the Browns had a bye week. <url>"
"Here's how I became an ambassador for <at>hbcuweek. Only a few days away from being there! Thanks <at>Hot97 for having me... <url>"
"I discussed elite black athletes and HBCU's on the <at>karenhunter show. Listen to full show here: <url> <url>"
"What the hell is going. This kid Minshew is out here for the <at>Jaguars looking like the <url>ing for Joe Montana. <at>Titans had better get something going or this can get ugly REAL QUICK!"
"I’m with you when you’re right <at>TomBrady. Too many damn penalties. Something has to give."
"I’m here <at>hbcuweek!!! <at>FirstTake <url>"
"Here’s what to expect from <at>FirstTake today LIVE from <at>hbcuweek! <url>"
"What a duo this could have been <url>"
"Damn! Very little surprises me. Even less moves me. But my college boys — my teammates — surprising me like this. Unreal!!! <url>"
"I said what I said! <url>"
"In <at>UMichFootball’s opening drive, we saw a WR devoid of breakaway speed, a QB that couldn’t connect on a slant pattern over the middle for a TD, and a RB (Mason) <url>mitted their 9th fumble of the season (6 lost). And we’re wondering why Harbaugh won’t win w/ these guys?"
"Damn great catch by <at>UMichFootball Ronnie Bell. Big time <url>pletely extended on that 22-yard catch. The kid can play. Ball can touch ground so long as <url>pletely secure so it should be ruled a catch. But again, the kid’s got skills."
"Just ruled a non-catch by <at>UMichFootball’s Bell. Bogus. Should’ve been a catch. This kid is the only thing I like about the Wolverines’ Offense right now."
"Good Lord. The first QT hasn’t even ended yet and <at>BadgerFootball’s Jonathan Taylor already has 2 TD’s and 143-yards rushing after just scampering for a 72-yard TD run. The way <at>UMichFootball Offense is looking, this game is already over. Can’t see <url>ing back."
"I’m done watching this <at>BadgerFootball vs <at>UMichFootball game. UM is getting DESTROYED. Beat like they stole something. This is embarrassing. So much for Harbaugh’s team having a chance this game. Just a joke. I’m done!"
"The <at>UMichFootball had 2 Damn Weeks to prepare for this game. Can’t stop the run. Can’t pressure. No discipline. And that’s just the defense. The offense is so much worse. They should be ashamed of the way they look. They can’t run. Can’t protect the QB. Just horrible.#Damn!"
"This means the world to me. <url>"
"Ladies & Gentlemen, in the interest of fairness I have an announcement to make, regardless of <url>e: the <at>Giants have a new QB. And his name is Daniel Jones. Helluva game thus far"
"I think it's over for Antonio Brown. Unless a personality transplant occurs. <url>"
"I think Jay Gruden just lost his job tonight. What a disgraceful performance by the <at>Redskins offense. This is <at>FiftyDeuce you’re going against. Why is he being covered 1-on-1. The <at>ChicagoBears are having their way. I guess you can blame injuries, but damn! Year-after-year."
"Here's what we learned about the Redskins. <url>"
"When that beat drops ... <url>"
"<at>REALDJPREMIER <at>gangstarr Haaaa. Thanks my man"
"<at>JabariJYoung My Brother. So.....So proud of you and all you’ve <url>plished. You make me proud every time I see your work. Keep grinding. Keep climbing. Keep setting that example. Love ya bro! See ya soon."
"It was truly an honor to bring <at>FirstTake to the <at>hbcuweek Career Fair. Delaware State University accepted more than 250 applicants on the spot and awarded well over $1 million in scholarships. There have been 100 Full Ride Scholarships awarded so far. (📹 via WITN Channel 22) <url>"

"You’re more than <url>e <url>"
"Stay off the WEEEEEED <url>"
"The best player in the world is still <at>KingJames. <url>"
"It ain’t about just smoking weed. It’s about LOSING money over doing it, DAMMIT! <url>"
"A few things to take notice from today’s games: the <at>Browns answered the call and showed out. They deserve their props. So do the <at>Lions, win, lose or draw, along with the <at>BuffaloBills. Haskins was thrown into the lions den and looked miserable. Shocked if Gruden isn’t gone 2day"
"Looks like Teddy Bridgewater just lost this damn game for the <at>Saints by allowing that sack.......unless the <at>Saints defense manages to hold......which I doubt. But we’ll see."
"<at>Saints Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!
Who Dat!!!!!!!!!! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!!!!!
To Hell with Dem Cowboys’ (Fans!!!"
"How about THEM Cowboys?!?!?! <url>"
"I blame the Cowboys' offense for the loss. <url>"

"What a game! What a game! Bases loaded, <at>Nationals down 3-1 and Soho smacks a single to right. Error by R-Fielder and 3 runs score, bottom of the 8th. Nats take a 3-1 lead. THIS is what October’s are made for"
"Haaaaaaa! Unreal.....about anyone in the world BUT Anthony Kornheiser. He probably said: “Damn, the Nats blew it again. Same ole, Same ole. I’m going to bed”.........in the top of the 8th inning 😀😀😀.  Hilarious. <url>"
"Y’all, the very beginning of the AL Wild Card Game is being streamed here! And the whole damn game is on ESPN :-)  <url>"
"<at>Dame_Lillard I feel you bro. I DID say the lyrics were definitely better. But I love the beat Shaq used and the smooth delivery. But I hear ya! Jalen Ike it down this morning on <at>First Take"
"I'm gonna give <at>Dloading the benefit of the doubt! <url>"
"Oh, Hell Yes! <url>e to the pros, <at>Zionwilliamson . Ecstatic that you’re here. Now, know this...... <url>"
"This right here is what it’s all about: reaching back, extending a helping hand to those less fortunate than ourselves. And the fact that HBCU’s were smack dab in middle of whole process made it even better. Thank you all. My team & I could not have pulled this off without you! <url>"
"What is going on in this work....especially on “<at>GetUpESPN this AM? <at>Espngreeny has every single person up there with blazers on — no tie — with everyone of them looking like they’re trying to audition for <at>Chippendales. Even <at>LRiddickESPN. What is up, fellas? #Haaaaaaa!!!!"

"Lord Have Mercy. Zion might not even make it to the playoffs and still.........I can’t wait for this <url>ing NBA Season! Might be the best season in 25 years! <url>"
"I absolutely, positively loveeeeeed this (via <at>thecheckdown). Mayfield started this at Ohio State. This was payback. All in fun. <url>petition ppl. Suck it up <url>"
"I’ve said it many times and I’ll say it again: if Ben Simmons develops a jump shot, the <at>76ers will win the NBA Title <url>"
"This is one of the most embarrassing performances I’ve seen in MLB postseason history. The <at>Braves are getting blitzed 9-0....IN THE TOP OF THE 1ST INNING. <at>Braves’ pitchers can’t get anyone out. Can’t throw strikes, either. ATL hasn’t been up to bat yet"
"I think Zion's rookie year will be very similar to SHAQ's! <url>"

"I chatted with <at>patrickbetdavid about my career path and lots more! Watch it here: <url>"
"This is some straight BS. How many penalties are the <at>nyjets gonna get called against them? The officials are doing all they can to GIVE this game to the <at>dallascowboys. I swear!"
"J-E-T-S! JETS JETS JETS! <url>"
"Aaaahhhhhhhhhh! Go’ Head bro. Way to handle your business, dawg!!!!!!!! Proud of ya. Keep grinding. And btw....my Birthday is tomorrow...so thanks for the early Birthday present. <url>"

"The great <at>RobertIger joined my show to talk about his newest book, ""The Ride of a Lifetime."" <url>"
"I asked <at>RobertIger if it's important to be the smartest guy in the room. <url>"
"That called 3rd strike just now vs the <at>Yankees Brett Gardner was straight B.S. that was not a damn strike. I know the <at>astros are the better team and it’s gonna take a miracle to win this, but damn......they don’t need more help like shit.#BullS&$<at>"
"F&$<at>!!!!!’ Told y’all...I never believed in Alroldis Chapman. What in the HELL are you getting cute for, throwing back-to-back 84 mph sliders? For what????? They can’t hit his gas. Chapman got cute, period. Horrible pitching selection. Over in 6...just like I knew it would be."
"Yes yes I gotta give credit to the damn <at>dallascowboys today! <url>"
"This is what I’ve been waiting for. <url>"
"Love this picture: <url>"
"Another day, another nauseating Cowboys fan calling into my show. <url>"
"First of all, the <at>nyjets are awful. Secondly, Sam Darnold has never looked worse. Third, Adam Gaseous is worse than the rest of the team. He’s gonna get <at>LeVeonBell killed with his play-calling. He was never the right man for the job. Damn shame <at>nyjets are on National TV."
"Why in the hell is Sam Darnold still in this game??? For what Adam Gase? Makes no sense. But then again, it does. It’s the <at>nyjets we’re talking about."
"Hey. I don’t give a damn if the <at>Bengals go 0-16. All that means to me is that they didn’t pick the right man to REPLACE Marvin Lewis. It does not mean Marvin Lewis did not deserve to go! <url>"
"Finally! Finally! Finally!!!!!!! <url>"

"... we’ll get <url>petition that way."
"Congrats to the <at>Nationals. Cardiac kids — even if they’re one of the older teams in baseball. Soto is something special. And now that I’ve gotten that out the way, Hinch blew the damn game. You don’t have Greinke pitching that way and replace him with anyone but Gerrit Cole."
"No matter how Good Will Harris has been for the <at>astros in the postseason, you must go to Gerrit Cole — your damn Ace. You saw the <at>Nationals go to Corbin, right? That’s what you do. Hinch overthought a lot in Game 7. And it cost the <at>astros a title."

"Btw........no I did not forget to say Happy Birthday to my brother! <url>"
"Y'all know what time it is. <url>"
"Anthony Davis leaving the Lakers? PLEASE! <url>"
"Awwwww Damn!:-) <url>"
"Yeah, Yeah, <at>Realrclark25. I see you screaming on <at>GetUpESPN. You go ahead and do that. It won’t prevent your kittens — I mean “Tigers” — from taking this “L.” You better pray someone kidnaps Tua. If not YOU, SWAGU and <at>LSUfootball are going DOWN. You like the rhyme,😉.#RollTide!"
"LEBRON is just getting STARTED. <url>"
"Introducing my new segment... NO YOU DIDN’T! <url>"
"To my sisters <at>Chiney321 and Ros Gold-Onwude, to my brother <at>RealJayWilliams, fantastic job just now on <at>FirstTake interviewing <at>TheTraeYoung. See....it’s moments like this that brings a tear to this middle-aged man. Look at y’all making me proud, filling in this way.#😉👍😉✌️😅"
"Just when I was about to spread more love on <at>FirstTake  to my brothers, Dominique Foxworth and <at>damienwoody, this damn man Woody is sitting in my seat without a TIE. Man.....don’t make <url>e through this screen and deal with you. And before you open your mouth, watch ur tone!"
"I tell people all the time... EVERYBODY has to answer to somebody. <url>"
"Here we go again on <at>GetUpESPN. The whole crew, led by <at>Espngreeny and <at>LRiddickESPN looking like they’re auditioning for <at>Chippendales. Y’all are something! Haaaaa"
"How y’all let the Cowboys <url>e “AMERICA’S TEAM” ??? <url>"
"I said it years ago. I say it now. I will forever say this: <url>"
"I agree with the Clippers being fined and here’s why. <url>"
"It’s official. The <at>NCAA is a damn travesty. This kid Wiseman is ineligible — after already starting the season — because COACH Penny Hardaway is a booster? This is straight B.S. no wonder <at>KingJames and so many others are so against the NCAA. Hey <at>NBA, I’ve got an idea:"
"Go ahead afterall and add a 3rd round in the <at>NBA draft. Just make sure to create a route where kids can finish their education, plus have an insurance policy for potential injuries. Enough with the <at>NCAA. They just need to go. They make me so sick. Why’d the kid start the season"
"To my boys <at>SECNetwork: <at>TimTebow, <at>finebaum and <at>mspears96: ROLLLL TIDDDDEEE!!!!!! <url>"
"What in the Hell is going on with <at>AlabamaFTBL right now??? First, a fumble by Tua, messing up a TD. Then a muffed punt. Now an INT called back because of 12-men on the field. Who is this team right now????#Damn!!!!"
"This is the 3rd blitz we’ve seen from <at>LSUfootball where the defender was not even TOUCHED by <at>AlabamaFTBL’s offensive line.....having clear shots at Tua. This is not looking good, Damnit!!!"
"I’m done. I’m giving it up to <at>mspears96, <at>Realrclark25 and <at>ESPNBooger. What I’m seeing from <at>LSUfootball is an ass whupping in <at>AlabamaFTBL. Bama can’t stop them and, offensively, Tua & the boys ain’t doing anything. Too many mistakes, too. Just awful, just like Nat’l title GM."
"Add dropped touchdown passes to the lost of <at>AlabamaFTBL mistakes. That was a perfect throw to Jeudy and he flat-out dropped it.#IAmDepressed!"
"The <at>LSUfootball Tigers went into Tuscaloosa and dropped 40!!! I can’t say a damn word. Because I did not see <url>ing!"
"About damn time Jeudy. That was the 2nd TD pass you dropped, fore making up for it by catching that one. NOW <at>AlabamaFTBL..whatcha gonna do. Can you get 1-damn-stop and get Tua the ball back with enough time left? Can you do it? It’s time, damnit!"
"I don’t even know who this <at>AlabamaFTBL team is. Could not get a single stop that mattered all game long. <at>LSUfootball rolled into TUSCALOOSA and nearly dropped 50 on the Tide. Embarrassing performance by Bama’s D! Props to the Tigers. Can’t say a word!"
"I’m now going to be taking fan submissions for this segment. Please tweet me with #NoYouDidnt and I will include the best ones in my show!! 😀"
"If there was ever a time where I wish I WASN'T restricted by FCC airwaves, it would be RIGHT NOW, DAMNIT! <url>"
"Look Barry White — I mean <at>mspears96 — if you want people to <at>GetUpESPN, especially if you’re gonna be ready for ME.....you’d better get your energy up. Just because your <at>LSUfootball got LUCKY, doesn’t mean you get to recline and chill w/ Mr. <at>Chippendales, I mean <at>Espngreeny:-)"
"Disney+ has arrived, y'all. The best way to find it is by downloading the Disney Plus App or going to <url> I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.#LookOutWorld!!! <url>"
"Some more information on Kaepernick's workout... <url>"
"Make sure to tune into my sit down with <at>JHarden13 during my SportsCenter Special ahead of Clippers vs. Rockets tonight. <url>"
"When we think about <at>Astros, we use to think about their greatness being contaminated by them having an abuser on their squad. Now, we can add cheating to the list. Damn! <url>"
"I think it's likely that Colin Kaepernick gets a job in the NFL following his private workout. Assuming........ <url>"
"He’s the No.2-overall pick in the draft for a reason <url>"
"Now THIS is totally hilarious. What betrayal on the part of Austin Rivers. And I love it! <url>"
"This week’s edition of #NoYouDidnt!!! <url>"
"I’m sorry, but can this guy Mason Rudolph at least PRETEND he sees the rush? I mean, these are not blind-side blitz’s the <at>Browns are throwing at him. He’s acting like he can’t freakin move out the way.#Damn!"
"Go to <at>MylesLGarrett page and you’ll see the headline: “A Hero is made by the path he chooses, not by the power he is graced with.” Yet, he goes and does what he did to Mason Rudolph. This calls for an automatic SEASON-ENDING SUSPENSION. He should be DONE for the rest of the year"
"And btw....neither Pouncey nor DiCastro should be suspended AT ALL. All they did was protect a defenseless teammate — who happened to be their damn QUARTERBACK. They shouldn’t be penalized at all."
"“Indefinite” attached to a suspension with the NFL means something, folks: that there’s more <url>e. <url>"
"He doesn't want to play. <url>"
"<at>E_Reid35 Man, please. You embarrass yourself <at>E_Reid35 every single time you open your mouth. You — of all people — talking of tap dancing when you’re the one collecting a check from the very institution you collect a check from. You <at>E_Reid35, who takes a knee — supposedlyfor brothers —"
"<at>E_Reid35 Yet attack brothers — Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z, ME — at every turn the second someone disagrees with you. You <at>E_Reid35 got the nerve to call out the <at>NFL when your beef was suppose to be with society in regards to police brutality and racial oppression. Where’s your plan?"
"<at>E_Reid35 Huh <at>E_Reid35? To call our or beat up everyone who utters a word you disagree with? All Brithers, BTW. Let me tell you something Mr. <at>E_Reid35: Kaepernick has been supported. We’ve all said he was done wrong. That he was blackballed. That he should be in the league. Who the hell"
"<at>E_Reid35 Hasn’t acknowledged that? But life isn’t fair. It damn sure ain’t ideal. And at some point, you’ve got the grab the opportunity. Kap’s occurred today. And what does he do: alters the process, and shows up with a T-Shirt alluding to SLAVERY <at>E_Reid35. For a JOB INTERVIEW! When"
"<at>E_Reid35 are you — yes, you <at>E_Reid35 — going to wake the hell up and realize that maybe, just maybe, the enemy at THIS POINT ain’t the NFL. It’s not Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z or ME. Maybe the enemy is YOU, your childish tendencies and your unwillingness to accept that you can’t run......."
"<at>E_Reid35 a damn thing but so much when your hand is out for someone else’s dime or product. Especially when you haven’t played in 3 years, when you were 1-10 in your last 11 games as a starter and the top-4 league MVP candidates are all black <at>E_Reid35. When will you learn?"
"<at>E_Reid35 Chances are.....you won’t. Because your ears are clogged and you’re too blinded by vitriol to see when a brother is showing you — y’all — love and respect <at>E_Reid35 by simply letting you know what will work at what won’t. But oh, I forgot: we all ain’t S&<at>$ in your world. So..."
"<at>E_Reid35 why even bother. You’ll never listen. But others will hear <at>E_Reid35. You can bet the house on that. Just listen. <url>ing from the multitude of places. And it’s damn sure — like a storm — on <at>FirstTake Monday morning. So buckle the hell up!
Good luck on Sunday. Sincerely!"
"Excuse the couple of spelling errors. I was driving before pulling off the road"
"<at>E_Reid35 ... The more you talk, the more ridiculous you sound, <at>E_Reid35: <url>"
"The fact that Colin Kaepernick didn't show up to his original workout location eradicates his points altogether. <url>"
"This is what needs to be said about the Kaepernick situation. <url>"
"Listen to this, Damnit! <url>"
"I went on <at>karenhunter’s show to discuss whether or not Colin Kaepernick really wants to play. Watch the full damn thing here! <url>"
"Hey, <at>KingJames is still the Greatest — TODAY! But let me be clear: I'll never take LeBron over MJ and here's why. <url>"
"You know what time it is!!! <at>SportsCenter with Stephen A starts at 7pm EST. DON’T MISS IT! <url>"
"Yeah! Yeah! You know what time it is in the <at>NBA tonight <url>"
"Here it is... this week's edition of #NoYouDidnt!!! <url>"
