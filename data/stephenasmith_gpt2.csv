"I was asked to do this :-) <url>"

"Damn! Damn! Damn! <at>RealSkipBayless is gonna have a field day tomorrow after LBJ missed that last shot. 1st Take will be on ESPNews tomorrow"
"Kevin Durant is a Closer! This is why folks say he's everything LBJ is not. It's what he's doing in the 4th QT. Popovich is looking for ans."
"Thank you so much, <at>BigBooty_Lucy23. And btw....love the twitter name."
"As for OKC, Harden's a star. Westbrook's a star. And Durant is whatever the hell he wants to be. Mad respect 2 SA, but I'm a believer in KD."
"Speaking of Jackson, that Tech called against him was straight BOGUS. This is why the officiating needs to be addressed."
"Now Durant is drawing off. Fouls.  Amazing. Btw.......Westbrook has to stop. He's starving so much to be involved offensively, he's F**** up"
"Oh stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless. This game wasn't lost by SA. It was won by Durant and OKC. Special moment. Don't rain on it!"
"AMERICA, y'all can say what you want but this is some SPECTACULAR stuff we're seeing from LeBron. SPECTACULAR. Can't say a word right now!!!"
"8:36 left in 3rd. Boston pulls w/in 60-48. Miami TO! LeBron is screaming at coaches to get him the ball as he walks to bench. Damn Right!"
"What the hell do you mean you don't know <at>Shaq. Are you watching this? Durant is PURE! Ice! Money!"
"I think I pulled off a first, folks. On Sportscenter tonight with Skip, I think I called the Final Score EXACTLY!!!!!!"
"For those of you who didn't see <url>mercial spoof of <at>RealSkipBayless, check it out: <url>"
"Damn Shame! James Harden shriveling up before our very eyes. Durant not aggressive enough. Westbrook actually has to take over. Sad!"
"That's right Westbrook: TAKE OVER! He's the only one on OKC who really seems to want it. Everyone else is FOLDING!"
"Harden! What a sorry performance. Another missed shot. And Durant! You're down 3 with a minute left and you give it up to SEFOLOSHA! Oh Damn"
"Although OKC is still the best in the West, the Lakers are actually the ones with the best shot to beat Miami -- the favorites -- next year."
"Nash is a scoring threat, frees up Kobe and will make Bynum and Gasol happy. LA in the Finals turns Miami into a perimeter team. No Good MIA"

"<at>Dick_Hardwood Crack Smoker."
"Let me be clear about my feelings on Penn State. This is about SEXUAL MOLESTATION. Anyone quick to jump to Joe Pa's or PSU's defense should"

"there's no football at Penn State for the foreseeable future. Minimum next five years."
"All this talk about Lin, like he's the <url>ing of Chris Paul is ridiculous. Stop it! <url>"
"Look Damnit! I've stated my position. I wish PSU were fined $200-million instead of just $60 million. I hope the kids/Coaches transfer."
"CHILDREN were raped. Molested. And folks turned a blind eye/deaf ear to what was going on. There's nothing to discuss here. NOTHING AT ALL."
"I am so sick and tired of the 2012 Dream Team being disrespected. Maybe Jordan/Pippen would stop them. But they're legit. Deserves respect."
"Oh, Stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless. You know better. Just stop it!"
"Let's all take a moment to sent our heartfelt condolences to Coach Andy Reid and his family for their loss. A pain all of wish to avoid."
"Barring any last minute snag, D-Howard will be a Laker by tomorrow. Bynum will be in Philly. And we'll all expect a Lakers/Heat Finals."
"Unless OKC or the Clippers have something to say to the Lakers. Only Boston has a chance of derailing the Heat in the East!!!"
"Not so fast, <at>SnoopDogg. OKC and Miami may have something to say about that!"
"I'm tired of <at>RealSkipBayless already. And the damn show hasn't even started yet. From NFL to NBA to Tebow, he just won't stop. Lawdy!"
"Ha! Ha!!!!! Does not get any better than this folks!!!!! <url>"
"Yes, <at>reggie_bush. So does the DNC. If we can have games all over the place, we damn sure should highlight politicians controlling our lives"
"I'm gonna say this right now: Pres. Obama is someplace with tears in his eyes right now -- CRYING over that SENSATIONAL speech by his wife."
"Michelle Obama worked it. Right down to the core of his words, the tears in her eyes. The passion oozing from her breath. SENSATIONAL SPEECH"
"The kind of speech that would shake any man to his core, knowing he has a woman by his side that supportive. What a fantastic FIRST LADY."
"I still want issues, though. Love the speeches. Appreciate them. But that won't determine my vote. REGISTERED INDEPENDENT!"
"I'm do ticked off this morning. Bad enough the Giants lost. Now I have to listen to <at>RealSkipBayless, too. Damn! FIRST TAKE. Top of the hour"
"Tebow won't be needed much if Sanchez keeps throwing the ball this way :-)"
"Oh! Message for <at>RealSkipBayless: Don't think for 1 second you're gonna give credit to Tebow if he accumulates yds in garbage time. No Sir!"
"Oh Puh-leeze, <at>RealSkipBayless. Smith was playing vs garbage defense. Rodgers vs. Arguably the best in the game. Wake up for a change!"
"Talking to <at>RealSkipBayless about <at>TimTebow is like talking to a brick wall. I'm not heard no matter what I say!"
"Okay Clay Matthews. I see you! I see you! AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Told y'all Cutler would be on Suicide watch!"
"Damn! Peppers is a BEAST!!!!!!!!!!"
"Btw......I'm hearing that Floyd Mayweather tweeted me. Can't find it. Can anyone find it for me, please!"
"Ok, this officiating is not funny anymore. It's really bad and the NFL needs to do something about it. Seriously!"
"Watkins throw under that wildcat formation looked better than anything Tebow's thrown (Haaaaa)"
"Tebow runs wrong route. Ball hits him upside his helmet/head. Lawd have mercy!"
"Before anyone even asks, I had no problem with Jay Pharoah's impersonation of me on SNL. I think he's hysterical. All love!!!"
"Will someone put an end to these substitute referees. What a horrible, horrible roughing the passer call vs GB to continue that Sea Drive."
"Plus, there's been 4-consecutive calls. This is so bad, it can't be put into words. Just <url>plete unmitigated disaster. Just horrible."
"That's it! I'm done. CLEARLY AN INTERCEPTION. The NFL should be ashamed of itself for allowing this officiating to regress to this point."
"JUST DISGRACEFUL! ABSOLUTE ROBBERY IN THE NFL. The league has thrown away it's integrity. That can't say anything to the players anymore."
"Golden Tate with a Blatant pass interference on Sam Shields. Then Jennings had the ball, brings it to his chest. All Tate has on ball is arm"
"Horrible! Just Horrible.If I'm the Packers, I would refuse to go back out on the field to be there for the xtra pt. I just wouldn't do it."
"If the NFL wants to maintain any credibility whatsoever, it should OVERTURN this decision IMMEDIATELY. This game should be awarded to GB."
"I CAN'T WAIT for FIRST TAKE this morning. What I saw was a damn DISGRACE. That's all I have to say . See y'all on ESPN2 at top of the hour."
"This is unbelievable. The 49ers are running <at>TimTebow plays better than the Jets do for Tebow. Lawd have mercy."
"Can't believe I'm about to say this, bit it may be time for <at>TimTebow. Sanchez looks awful right now. Fans are booing. Might as well!"
"This is how embarrassing things are: MetLife stadium is still loud...b/c 49ER fans Are all over the place. The Jets are atrocious. Horrible."
"Oh Stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless. Don't even try to make this about <at>TimTebow. They collective stink. Nobody's sparking them today."
"TONY OH-NO!!!! Pathetic! Cowboys are just sorry tonight. Like I keep telling <at>RealSkipBayless, accident waiting to happen."
"JESUS!!!!!!!!!!! Romo has 5 Interceptions. I wonder what <at>RealSkipBayless is gonna say tomorrow!!!!!!!!!"
"Huh? <at>mcuban"
"That -- RIGHT THERE -- is why CC Sabathia is Big-Time. Surrender's 8th inn double with No Outs, then shuts down the side. BIG-TIME!"
"YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! Russell Martin in the house. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
"Canooooo..............DON'T YA KNOW!!!!!!!!!!"
"Derek Jeter gets hurt on my Birthday. How can this happen to me!"
"Thank you so much for the kind words, <at>cbm1013. You inspire me :-)"
"RG3 is simply the truth!"
"Damn, Sanchez! Damn!"
"Make it happen!"
"Hearts and prayers are with Marcus Lattimore. Hate to see that."
"I hate that James Harden is gone. He's bigtime, despite being M.I.A. In Finals. But OKC made a damn-good deal for itself. Still best in West"
"Haaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!! Romo.......ANOTHER INTERCEPTION. Like I said.....COWBOYS ARE AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN."
"The NBA Season is here. I'm so hyped for this season I don't know what to do with myself. This may be best season I've covered in 20 years."
"I have facts, <at>Gregory305 you have emotion. Take off your skirt."
"Awwww man! Amar'e Stoudemire's now out 6 weeks.....now that he received a 2nd opinion on his knee. Damn! Damn! Damn! This is ticking me off."
"Always, money. So ready for this NBA season. Ain't worried about a thing else."
"NBA Preview <url>ing your way RIGHT NOW on FIRST TAKE on ESPN2. The season is here. AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!"
"Then why the hell are you watching, <at>pkcourt. What the hell do you want is to talk about? This ain't Martha Stewart of QVC. It's Sports."
"I don't care what mode <at>realskipbayless is in. I'm wondering if he even knows what he's watching."
"Btw.........Ray Allen getting the cold shoulder from KG. Allen is class personified, but I don't blame KG one bit."
"You're smoking crack, <at>RGWJ. Tebow can't throw. Just mentioning him in the same breath as LeBron is stupid."
"And when I say God Bless, it's not just for the well-being of my family..but each and everyone of y'all. We get thru these moments TOGETHER."
"Russell Westbrook has ruined my damn day. <at>RealSkipBayless is smiling ear-to-ear. Damnit! FIRST TAKE in the house on ESPN2..RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!"
"Oh stop it, <at>RealSkipBayless. You said Cam had to win and he did. Own it and be quiet. At least until tomorrow morning!"
"And btw.....folks can sleep on Luck if they want. He may not be an electrifying athlete, but the boy can play QB. Indy will tell you that."
"What I'm seeing from the Eagles right now is so incredibly embarrassing, so disheartening, I am officially at a loss for words. HORRIBLE D!"
"With that being said, what a BEAUTIFUL MORNING it is today, folks :-)"
"Btw.....MELO will be in the MVP conversation this year. Mark my words."
"Here's all I'm going to say: You pick D'Antoni as next coach for Lakers if you want to entertain for 82 gms. You pick PJ to win titles."
"ROOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL TIDE!!!"
"Johnny Football played a great game. Very impressive. He's a strong candidate for the Heisman. Nothing but respect. I WAS WRONG on this one."
"Here's what I'm ticked off about already: Vick is out w/ a concussion and suddenly with Foles in, the Eagles' off line is blocking suddenly."
"I mean, What The Hell??? Haven't Eagles' fans been asking them to do this all season long."
"So much for all that talk about the Nick Foles starting in place of Vick. What a disaster."
"Btw......can we officially close this book of a season on the NY Jets? Their defense scored their ONLY point. Their offense did squat. Sad!"
"I'm here at the Clips/Heat Game. Let me tell y'all something: <at>KingJames is using post moves on Blake Griffin. EFFECTIVELY. That is trouble."
"By that I mean..if <at>KingJames gets to a pt where his post game is like THAT, it's over for the entire NBA. And I do mean over!"
"Also....Jamal Crawford just boogied on Ray Allen. 7-quick points off the bench. Instant offense. If on, he's a difference maker."
"#NBAGAMETIME Haaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Kidd still has it in  him. Go NY, Go NY, Goooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"#NBAGAMETIME Big-time win by the Knicks. I'm impressed. Good night for Knicks' fans."
"Like I told y'all, Melo will be an MVP Candidate for the Knicks. If they continue to win. The dude is unstoppable when he's on."
"I'm so Thankful for my Mom's Health, along with the tremendous love I receive from family and friends. Wishing all of you a Happy One Today."
"I tried to tell y'all about them Cowboys. What a waste. Get Garrett out of there. At least you'll know you're moving in a right direction."
"I knew the Jets would get blown out....EVENTUALLY. What I never imagined is that they've be this God-Awful. What a freakin' disgrace!"
"I knew the Jets would get blown out, but not like this. This is <url>plete annihilation. Warranting change. Season is over. Thank God!"
"I simply cannot believe that the Knicks picked the night they're facing Jeremy Lin to stink up the joint. I'm so ashamed of them right now!"
"People, <at>DwyaneWade would be happy because Crean is his former coach at Marquette. I really wonder about some of you folks sometimes!"
"You're pathetic, <at>RealSkipBayless. I can't believe you're resorting to these bush-league motivational tactics! Scared of ur own pick? Damn!"
"I'm told this article on me was a good one: <url> You guys be the judge and let me know."
"For those who didn't see today's edition of FIRST TAKE, take a peek: <url> It'll speak for itself!"
"I don't drink ladies and Gentlemen. I can count on 10 fingers how much alcohol I accumulate in an entire year!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, Raymond Felton is putting on a show. I can't believe what I'm seeing from the Knicks right now. Hope it lasts!"
"I honestly cannot believe my eyes. The Knicks have BLOWN OUT the Heat. It's 3:47 left and the building is clearing. I have been awakened."
"The Knicks are officially a joke NO MORE. They have put the World Champions on notice. As well as the rest of us. The Knicks <url>ing!"
"Yours truly with ""E!"" Star -- and a future Hollywood star, at that: <url>"
"And of course I had to take one with my boy <at>IAmSteveHarvey: <url>"
"Haaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!! Johnny-FOOTBALL wins the Heisman! Told ya <at>RealSkipBayless. Told ya Christian Fauria! His #'s too ridiculous 2 ignore."
"I just can't bring myself to do pay-per-view. But I do love Pacquaio/Marquez. But I just can't do it. I HAVE MY PRIDE :-)"
"OMG! What a KNOCKOUT. Paqman....out on his FACE. What do you have to say now <at>RealSkipBayless. What do you have to say now???"
"Who the hell said I did not see the fight. Are y'all crazy. What I said was....I refused to PAY for it. That's all. I saw Pacman on his FACE"
"Ravens def. should be ashamed of themselves. I don't care what anyone says. They were given an 8-pt lead and RGIII went down. Enough said."
"Here's Part 3 with me and Kobe: <url>"
"Here's Part 4 with Me and Kobe: <url>"
"Me and Kobe, Part 2: <url>"
"I can't lie: This is an incredibly sad day for me, especially in light of these kids being killed. Tragic! Spread love to everyone you love!"
"But what you need to understand <at>roddywhiteTV is that y'all always do damage during regular season -- then tank it during the playoffs."
"Relax! Chill out! And it's not like someone called you T-I-A-G-O SPLITTER."
"Btw.......forgive me folks if I didn't have much to say during the weekend. Still don't, actually. After the tragedy in NEWTOWN, Family is"
"All that's been on my mind this weekend. God Bless. Seriously!"
"I've lost all respect for the 49ers for even allowing this to happen. They should be ashamed of themselves."
"it's absolutely fitting that the Jets lost the game this way. Stupid INT by Sanchez. Botched shotgun snap b/t an experienced center and QB."
"This is what happens when you ignore your offense and rely on gimmicks/winning headlines to solidify your stature in NFL. Pathetic Fiasco."
"My man, <at>DanielMathias_. Is that really necessary? About sports? After what transpired last week?"
"Just in case no one has noticed, I'm near 1 Million Followers on Twitter. All I can say is that's a true blessing. Thank you all!"
"I am OFFICIALLY over 1 Million Twitter followers. Wanted to take a moment to thank you all for the love/support. Very very much appreciated!"
"Regular season. Why is everyone acting like today's game is determining something. We've got six months to go. Calm down."
"I know I'm on vacation, but someone had to try and explain why Avery Johnson was fired. Leave it to yours truly : <url>"
"Buffalo is blowing out the Jets. What an appropriate ending for the absolute most dysfunctional team in Football. Pathetic Ending!"
"Just so y'all know: Both myself and <at>RealSkipBayless WILL BE BACK on FIRST TAKE tomorrow morning. Nice wk off. But can't wait to get back!"
"Haaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!! Tony Romo. He never -- ever -- let's me down!"
"Be quiet, <at>RealSkipBayless. You believed him Tony ""OH NO"" All these years. Don't crucify him now."
"Now see, that's some B.S. Right there -- that Roughing-the-passer call on Hatcher. Hands were open. He's being blocked. Weak, weak call."
"I want Dallas to lose. Picked them to lose. But not like this. What a bogus damn call. Let them play. My God!!!"
"I Was suppose to have OFF from Radio today. But the second they told me Tannenbaum had been fired by the Jets, I just couldn't resist."
"The Piece of #*<at>$ is YOU <at>Andrew_Leary21, and everyone who wants to ignore the atmosphere that allowed Sandusky to prowl after KIDS."
"When I give a damn what you believe, <at>carrsqr, I'll be sure to let you know."
"I don't care, <at>mark__monte. I don't give a damn whether you respect me or not. And that goes for anyone who disagrees w/ me on Sandusky!"
"Does anyone see this nonsence, <at>karessayanez just said to me????"
"No place nor excuse for hate in this world, <at>ZNENDrii. All is does is preoccupy your heart and mind with negativity. #wastedenergy"
"Wow! Not one but 2 Ray Rice fumbles today. Can't believe it!"
"ROOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL TIDE!"
"OH MY GOD!!!!!!!! An Annihilation. Brent Musburger said it best: ""If This Were A Prize Fight, They'd Call It Off."" Damn!!!"
"Watching OKC vs. Lakers. All I'll say is this: <at>KDTrey5 may end up being the GREATEST SCORER I'VE EVER SEEN IN NBA HISTORY. Seriously."
"He wants NO PART OF ME, BRUH! Trust!!!"
"Lawd Have Mercy! Just hearing about the Te'o story. I'll sleep on this and reserve my thoughts for tomorrow morning on FIRST TAKE. Buckle up"
"First take in the house. Buckle up. I'm <url>ing this morning!"
"Don't like it, <at>GTi_GRiiNDeR. Take your behind to another channel and watch something fake. Real <url>es real! Goodbye!"
"Scared of what I'll say next on FIRST TAKE on ESPN2. About Armstrong! About Te'o. Pray for me! :-)"
"So, in the end, it doesn't matter who concocted the scheme or when. All that matters is that Te'o ultimately told knew and conveyed PUBLICLY"
"What he conveyed. It's JUST MY OPINION, but I don't see how he was totally hoodwinked over the course of 3 years. Not buying it!"
"I don't give a damn about his personal life, <at>KalaBabu08. I care about addressing news, which is what he made himself into. Deal with it!"
"I'm done talking Te'o. God Bless him. He's a kid, no matter what I believe happened. I've got NFL on my mind. Can't wait for games tomorrow."
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ravens did it. Shut out TOM BRADY in the 2nd Half. Shut........THEM............OUT!!!!!!!!!"
"You know what, anybody who has a problem on my Te'o position can go KICK ROCKS! Don't give me some damn nonsense about ""Catfish!"" We're not"
"Talking about something that spanned 3 weeks. It spanned 3 years. 3-damn-years. Y'all believe what you want and I'll do the same. But......"
"Don't go telling me that my position on this matter makes no sense. As far as I'm concerned, it does. End of discussion."
"I've held back enough. I'm going IN on the Lakers. Enough's Enough Damnit. FIRST TAKE. ESPN2. 10AM EST. BE THERE!!!!!!!!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm about to go LIVE on Sportscenter again right now. LakerNation: Don't watch. Consider yourself warned!"
"You can appease a 1,000 ppl, but folks harp on the one person bitching! Ya can't please everybody. Real men understand that. Weaklings don't"
"To the Omega's out there who have my back, appreciate the love. For all the others, Kick Rocks!"
"My condolences to the Celtics. Devastating loss with Rondo (torn ACL) for them. That's it for their chances. Lakers? Be teased if y'all want"
"Yours <url>ing on Sportscenter RIGHT NOW!!!! Holla at ya boy!"
"For the record, I'm saying A.I. Deserves A SHOT!!! You want him to try out, put him on an NBA squad....not the D-League. Then see!"
"It's called a legitimate tryout. Something worthy of an individual who largely contributed to transcending the NBA, no matter the mistakes."
"Such a happy day for me. CRIS CARTER -- MY COLLEAGUE, MY FRIEND -- inducted into THE HALL OF FAME. Finally. So, so Happy for this man!"
"For those interested in hearing the Sermon -- yes Sermon -- I gave last Sunday in Decatur, Ga, here's a way to get it: <url>"
"There is no hypocrite in me. Would never pretend to be something I'm not......especially in God's House. Please know this!"
"You're nothing but an ignorant racist, <at>AldermanEri2. Look at your words, what you say. Ppl like you make my pt for me everyday. Goodbye!"
"That's a Fumble!!!!!!!!!!!"
"That was a terrible call by John Harbaugh. May cost them. Totally unnecessary,"
"BEYONCE is a baaaaaaddddddd MAMA JAMA!!! If y'all don't know, Y'all better ask somebody."
"This is TERRIBLE. INEXCUSABLE. And Embarrassing. Somebody should pay for this!"
"Please, please please get one, <at>serenawilliams. You in THAT Beyonce outfit! Pretty please, with Sugar on Top! :-)"
"This is sickening. If somehow B'More's momentum in thwarted here, what do you say. I'd ban the SB from New Orleans for next 20 yrs for this!"
"Okay! I'm gonna calm down. I understand these things happen. My cuz is an Engineer. But damn, I'm so disgusted with this!"
"You would know, <at>TimFPurcell. Punks always do."
"How would you know, <at>theshakisback, unless you're one yourself!"
"This is some straight-up B.S. A Power Outage changes the momentum. DISGRACEFUL!"
"Congratulations to my brother RAY LEWIS......Super Bowl Champion!"
"I'm going to tell a few fools on this one more time: no matter what insults you spew, watch your language or you're getting blocked."
"Y'all can believe <at>RyanRuocco's unsensible rant all y'all want to :-). No way in hell Knicks have greater upside than DERRICK ROSE' Bulls."
"Want to take a moment to thank all the students at FairField U <url>ing out to HEAR me speak tonight. Appreciate the love. Thanks so much!"
"The stupid one is you, <at>CBC_2519. Never said he didn't hold. I said I DON'T CARE. He initiated contact. It's the SB. Get over it!"
"Should've said UNC/Duke B-Ball, Yankees/Red Sox Baseball, Or Michigan/Ohio State College Football."
"Relax peeps. The Heat are champions. Were looking for revenge from last minute. And CP3 and Chauncey were rusty. Clips are not THIS bad."
"Haaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tim Hardaway Jr. To the Rescue again. The young brother is COLD!!!!!!!!!!! Just like his Daddy was! Ha! #MakeMeProud."
"OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH DAMN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Unbelievable shot. Give the brother credit. Overtime for Wisconsin/Michigan!"
"This kid Brust...Bigtime performance. My Philosophy: if ya see a kid with a #1 on their jersey,.LOOK OUT! Beware of Wisc FT Shooting though."
"Wow! What <url>eback by ND -- Jerian Grant. 3 Bigtime 3's vs. L'ville. Plus 3-pt play. 12 pts in last 30 seconds. Wow! Loving CB Today."
"I'm not going to lie, considering all their Health issues I didn't think the Lakers would be in this game right now. #MuchRespectLANation."
"The Black Mamba is putting on a show! Should've known better. #SorryLakersNation"
"But the Lakers are still not winning this game!"
"Initial thoughts on the Grammy's: Only Beyonce can make that outfit look fly. Alicia Keys was Special. And so was J-Lo, though her legs"
"FIRST TAKE in the house....on ESPN2 RIGHT NOW!!! <at>RealSkipBayless is trippin over <at>KingJames again. Oh Lawd!!!!!! Somebody help me please!"
"Stop lying, <at>MkY101. What I said was: Wade, Melo and Kobe were considered the best CLOSERS yrs ago. Quote me accurately or not at all."
"First of all, watch your damn mouth on my page, <at>Shizz105. Secondly, I'm stating fact. If I can criticize <at>KingJames  when he doesn't get"
"Do not ever disrespect that man D-Rose, <at>Jamez_9. Don't you do it!"
"You Lakers' fan are getting on my damn  nerves. I didn't say the Lakers will lose by 30 for NOTHING! Gasol is out. Howard is hurt. #Problem?"
"You sorry punk, <at>StreetSoar86. Did you tell folks how you screamed from a distance, calling me names and then shut up when I responded."
"Man, I just heard my man <at>JayPharoah did a skit on me again on SNL. I didn't see it folks. I'm busy in Houston. Missed it. Damn!"
"Look idiot, <at>bc4_bc. The subject was the trading deadline. I've been saying D'Antoni wasn't right man for the job for months #GroundHogDay!"
"When you can't speak respectfully, you're gone, <at>_davidfassil. You missed your opportunity <url>municate. Have a nice life."
"How much do you get paid, <at>gj131313?"
"It's not hating, <at>UpperHand38. It's called reporting."
"WHAT A FREAKIN' DISASTER. I'll see y'all tomorrow AFTERNOON for First Take. I'm not even showing up to the morning show after this!"
"Not true at all, <at>Wokda. When <url>es to FIRST TAKE, <at>RealSkipBayless and I are 50/50. We Ride Together/We Die Together. Bad Boys 4 Life!"
"I told y'all this once before and I'll tell y'all this again about Lil Bow Wow on 106th and Park: I DON'T DEBATE TODDLERS!"
"If ya missed me, I'mmmmm Baaaaaaccckkkkk! Live on FIRST TAKE on ESPN right now. Holla!"
"You're officially blocked, <at>BiblesNBlowjobs.  Your twitter name alone should have you banned!"
"Plain and simple. Watch the damn interview. And for those questioning my BLACKNESS, let me be clear: KICK ROCKS! Especially to those who"
"Wouldn't take a stance on any damn thing if it cost them $5 out of their pocket. Get some guts -- and heart -- <url>e talk to me!"
"Calm down, <at>cjdyer25. I don't pretend to know a damn thing about Hockey. Was just having fun with Barry Melrose. It's not that serious."
"Oh HEELLLLL NO.....Dwight Howard didn't just take that jump shot."
"Excellent reversal by referee Tony Brothers. That was not a Flagrant 1 by Kenyon Martin."
"It's true...as much as i hate to admit it. Understand, if Tiago Splitter balls, TD has help on the frontline. Makes the Spurs lethal!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, Jeff Green is putting on a show. This moment is what Ainge and Doc acquired him from OKC for. #Unbelievablethusfar"
"That should not have been a technical foul on LeBron. But give Celtics credit: Showing a whole lot of heart. Enough to make you believe:"
"If they had everyone healthy, the East wouldn't be as locked up as most of us think it would be."
"Then again, it's only the first half. I'm still expecting the Heat <url>e back from this."
"What the hell is going on? Why is this happening to Miami. I refuse to believe -- even now -- that they'll lose this game."
"Not good if <at>KingJames loses in Cleveland. Even if he's off his game........his teammates need to pick him up."
"Watching FIRST TAKE and feeling like a proud papa watching <at>jemelehill and Michael Smith. Y'all go 'head. And yes I'm old enough to say that"
":-)"
"Pay attention <at>FearTheTurtle24. I'll give any member of the Cowboys are hard time. They stink! Damn shame they're called AMERICA'S TEAM!"
"Bye <at>SportsAce214. We won't miss you!"
"They stink, <at>TomSheldon22. Tell <at>DezBryant to call me when the Cowboys make the playoffs and stop getting spanked by NFC Foes <at> season end"
"Oh, I'm so scared  <at>SBozz9SSP. Spare me!"
"You're America's JOKE, <at>_G_NO. How many playoff appearances/victories have you had in the last 17 Years? Kick rocks with that damn nonsense"
"The Cowboys are that Fine-as-Hell woman that keeps saying ""Yes"" to a date and ""No"" to every nightcap, <at>hsouza14. Spending all you $$$.:-)"
"Who gives a damn. Cowboys fans should look at their team then punch themselves for rooting for them!"
"CowboysNation! Relax. I'm <url>ing at y'all as a NY Fan. I'm going to say y'all stink even when you don't. It just happens to be true ..."
"Tell'em I don't give a damn, <at>Terryhandley1. They know my number. Who's hiding? I'll <url>e on ESPN Radio in Dallas to say: THEY SUCK"
"I call it like I see it, <at>Centaur_. When cats deserve scrutiny, I give it. The same with praise. It's called being a grown-ass man. #Fair!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, please know if you can't watch your language on my page you will be blocked. Don't make me tell y'all again!"
"The Astros payroll is $25 mil, <at>gnofinder. A-Rod gets paid more than their entire roster this season. Where's <url>mitment to winning?"
"Watch First Take tomorrow. I'll save my fury for then. On a multitude of issues!"
"Big-Time win for the Heat/Bosh. Happy he got the chance to remind everyone the Heat are not all <at>KingJames and <at>DwyaneWade. Way da go!"
"Oh Lawd!"
"Um, excuse me, <at>mvpdream34. I picked Michigan. And Louisville!"
"I had the Knicks' winning <url>ing to an end today. I'm loving what I'm seeing. Very Proud!"
"Idiots, juveniles and ignorant folks with such poor vocabulary that they <url>ment w/o foul language will be blocked INSTANTLY!"
"Btw.....News Flash to Knicks' fans. Being a fan with the Pom Poms is YOUR JOB. Not mine! Even if I do root for the Knicks. DO YOUR JOB!"
"Apologize peeps. Had a personal matter to handle. But I'll be back on FIRST TAKE tomorrow morning. Have no doubt Broussard is doing it up!"
"OK, it's official: Knicks are the truth. Victory in Oklahoma City erases any doubt that New York can contend:  <url>    "
"B.S. That was a perfect block by Burke on Siva."
"I don't care if you're a fan of mine or not, <at>RatPackSands. You don't have to agree. <url>prehend. That's what makes the world go round."
"Already on Sportscenter about Kobe. Back on today at 1pm and 3pm, plus on ABC this afternoon. Will save <url>ments for then. #TickedOff."
"Damn! Mark Sanchez sitting courtside, just got roundly booed. Don't even know why they showed him on the jumbotron."
"These are the damn Boston Celtics. You'll need to do more to beat them. J.R. Smith is going to have to provide a punch. Gotta help out Melo."
"Don't know if anyone's seeing this, But Deron Williams is boogeying on these Bulls. <at>RyanRuocco should be proud. Boy is ballin!"
"Knicks Problems? No Ball movement whatsoever. Just Melo or JR going 1-on-1, launching long off-balance shots, then not getting back on D."
"Ooohhhh! Okay <at>DwightHoward. I see you. Power move to basket. Displaying aggression. <at>kobebryant would be proud. #Keepitgoing!"
"Irrelevant and ignorant, <at>Chuck_2Deuces2.  The NFL prohibits it and that's what matters. You either want to play in the league or not."
"<at>OGkingChuck If ya really did, you wouldn't be down 0-2 :-)"
"No need to look for me, peeps. I'm at Celtics/Knicks. Thought Knicks would STEAL 1 here. They're looking like they'll TAKE 2. #Brooms???"
"Good Lawd! The Knicks look as if they're on the verge of sweeping the Boston Celtics. Wow!"
"Nate Robinson has <url>PLETELY BERSERK. This is unbelievable, but impressive. As Steve Kerr would say....a REMARKABLE performance. #WOW!!"
"What a shot by <at>NateRobinson. An amazing shot. An amazing game."
"Btw.....let's give Joe Johnson some love. Owed $89-million, moments like this are why you get paid. He's answered the bell. #creditdue"
"<at>russwest44 Sorry about the injury, Bro! Keep your head and stay strong. <url>e back next season stronger than ever."
"His name is Durant. He is <at>KDTrey5, one of the most lethal scorers we'll ever see. Step up and act like it. Just like you did in 1st Half."
"Btw.....Kevin Martin needs to do something, too. I know he's no <at>JHarden13. But Damn!!!!!! He's got to bring something."
"Knicks are sloppy right now. 8 turnovers in first 13 min after avg 12 this series. Don't worry, though. Melo's off. Won't last. <url>ing!"
"Carmelo has got to pass the basketball. He's forcing things a bit too much!"
"I can't believe what I'm seeing tonight. I will reserve <url>ments for tomorrow on FIRST TAKE. #un-#<at>$#*-believable!"
"If <at>KevinHart4Real wants <url>e on FIRST TAKE, consider it done. Just expect a visit from me on Real Husbands of Hollywood #RHOH."
"I'm about to be on Sportscenter at the top of the hour. Why? SC has asked that <url>e on to discuss the LAKERS' exit interviews. #BuckleUp"
"Going in on LA right now on FIRST TAKE."
"Ppl like you are pathetic, <at>ro_man503. Always the guy okaying their screwups -- and never around to pay their bills when it costs them!"
"Don't know what will happen over final 9 min. But Knicks have been Horrendous. Especially JR Smith. Just Horrific!"
"Let me be the first to APOLOGIZE on how I'm going to be on FIRST TAKE this morning. I'm ticked the $#*<at>$ off. #DAMNDAMNDAMN"
"Btw......I'm pretty damn nervous about my Knicks. I DO NOT want a Game 7. Yes, I'm admitting it. I'm SCARED, damnit!"
"I think I'm going to be sick. I can't believe what I'm seeing right now."
"Hope y'all all enjoyed my Star <url>mercial. I haven't seen it yet but I'm hearing it's getting great reviews. Appreciate the love!"
"Win, lose or draw, this boy Nate Robinson is something else. So much heart, desire. Mad Respect. #TheLittleEngineThatCould"
"Wow! What a shocker. The Bulls beat the Heat tonight. Wonder what it says about Brooklyn and others. #JustThinkingOutLoud"
"For folks interested in losing weight and changing their diet, just saw this in the Wall Street Journal: <url>"
"Puh-leeze!"
"Stop hatin, <at>Mackadocious84. I've covered the league for 17 years. What the hell do you think we do? Say Hi-and-Bye! Grow the hell up!"
"Good Lawd, people. I thought the ""Lawd- Jesus-That's-A-Fire"" woman was something else. Now this: <url>"
"I'm sorry. I LOVE THE NBA. But these officials are ridiculous. Ezeli did NOT just deserve that Tech. You cannot take emotion out the game."
"You just can't take emotion out of the game. The league has to provide rhe officials some latitude. This has gotten out of control. #ENOUGH!"
"I'm not all media ppl, <at>bigtime1957. I'm Stephen A! For better/for worse, I'm my own damn man. Recognize!"
"Never be jealous, <at>swish30curry. I'm sure you're incredibly gifted at what you do. Pursue excellence and there's no need to worry."
"What's left then, <at>DPratt86. You? #ShutTheHellUp!"
"My name is Stephen A. Smith, <at>Damir92. And I approve your message :-)"
"I don't smoke, <at>TGODxTWANxJETS. Never have, excluding a couple of Cigars. Can you say the same? :-)"
"Look idiot, <at>BrunDog1996 I said if they didn't win Game 2, they COULD get swept. Keep misquoting me and I'll block your sorry behind!"
"I understand the refs had to eject Mohammed due to the rules. But I hate the rule. A punch would've been one thing. But a Shove? #ComeonNBA!"
"Tyson Chandler is one of my favorite pro athletes ever. Great Guy. But I've never seen him perform this badly. Hibbert has DOMINATED him!"
"Want to take a moment to say Happy Mother's Day to all the lovely Mothers out here -- but ESPECIALLY MY MOM. #TheGreatestWomanAlive!"
"Appreciate all the love I'm getting for that Star <url>mercial. Thank you so much. Y'all think I'm ready for the Big screen?:-) #HellNo!"
"TIGER wooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"What an HORRENDOUS PERFORMANCE by the Chicago Bulls. I know they had no energy tonight. But My Goodness."
"Stop asking me these damn questions. I have no explanation why Woodson won't put in Copeland or Novak or even the towel boy. #Frustrated!"
"Unbelievable to say this....but Chris Copeland MAY BE the Knicks only hope. He's the only want to take pressure off Melo."
"I'm sorry. I'm so disgusted today that I'M going in. NO MERCY! On anyone. To Hell with this. #DamnKnicksMakeMeMiserable!"
"Appreciate all the love everyone's giving me tonight over the Mickey <url>mercials. Much appreciated. Thank you. Sincerely!"
"D-Wade is unbelievable right now. Just unbelievable."
"What an ending. Mad Kudos to Nate Robinson and the Bulls. Lots of Heart. You go down, that's the way to do it. D-Wade rose up when needed!"
"I've never done this before, but I want y'all to watch FIRST TAKE today and judge a brother's wardrobe. I'm stepping out --taking a chance:)"
"Knicks down 29-27 at end of 1st, but I like this. At this pace, Knicks will win this game. Pacers don't excel at this pace."
"Knicks down 19-6 on the boards. Damnit!"
"Yyyyeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Copeland, Shumpert, JR. Do NOT disrupt the rhythm. Sorry Amar'e. No need for Woodson to disrupt this. Tyson or Martin w/ Melo and Shooters."
"End this Knicks. Make me out to be a damn liar. Bring this back to New York. To MSG. To the MECCA. RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally!"
"I was wrong the other day when I said Chandler had Hibbert like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. After that spin, who I meant was OLAJUWON!"
"I'm DEPRESSED right now, Ladies and Gentlemen. Not going to lie. Can't sleep. Won't eat. Don't wanna work! But I'll be on FIRST TAKE in AM."
"Just leave me be while I recover from this, please!"
"It was a joke, <at>jessicakratz. Moreso to highlight what guys usually don't like to do. Shame females took it wrong. Your response? Shameful!"
"Happy Memorial Day everyone."
"You've gotta be kidding me. Down 0-3 in this series, the <url>e out andforfeit a 24-12 deficit. Man, they're done. #SpursInFinals"
"I like the ""Birdman"" on Miami, but there's no way he should NOT have been ejected from this game."
"Lord help us all."
"Folks need to calm down. As much as it pained me, I picked the Spurs in 7 b/c D-Wade is hurt, and Miami and Bosh haven't looked good."
"And don't get me started on the Spurs depth, consistency, perimeter shooting and how there's no answer for Tony Parker. And what is SA zones"
"But <at>DwyaneWade is not healthy. We all know it. So it is what it is. These are the damn SPURS we're talking about here. #Respectthat'searned"
"I'm taking calls from everyone. 800.919.3776."
"What an explosion. Miami was DOWN by 1 pt with 3 minutes left in the third. Then the Heat exploded. Allen and Miller in together is HUGE."
"I'm not going to lie: after hearing the news on Chad Johnson, very little else is on my mind re: Sports right now. I'm so damn disgusted!!!!"
"I simply cannot believe Chad's silliness. You don't play around in court. Especially with a FEMALE judge presiding over DOMESTIC VIOLENCE."
"Get over it, <at>PunameCruncher. A man who strikes a woman better stand at attention in ANY COURT. Especially with a FEMALE JUDGE. Nice Avatar"
"I have absolutely, positively no idea what's up with <at>KingJames. All I know is that whatever it is, it won't last! Win or Lose Tonight."
"I really hope <at>DwyaneWade is okay after attempting to block Duncan's shot. He's playing fantastic."
"I've learned something I already knew just in the last few minutes. The Spurs CANNOT win w/o T. Parker. Even if they go up 3-1."
"Miami's right on course to win this game. It helps that TIAGO SPLITTER is <url>plete waste. And Manu Ginobli isn't must better. On both ends"
"Aaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <at>DwyaneWade has SHOWN UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Folks are getting on my damn nerves. I picked the Spurs in 7 at start! Then you analyze what you see. Whoever goes up 3-2 has got the series"
"How is this difficult <url>prehend. Game 5 will not decide this series!"
"I thought Pop should give Gary Neal more PT. Didn't see Ginobili in the starting <url>ing. Gutsy move on Pops' part. Got Ginobili going"
"Here's the deal: D-Wade is the MVP for Miami right now, but tonight is about Pops' brilliant move to START Manu --  somrthing I didn't see."
"Now we'll see how Spoelstra responds to Pops latest chess move. It's ain't checkers, that's for sure. We'll know the results in 12 minutes."
"Here's all I'm noticing right now: Tim Duncan ain't trying to have a Game 7. He's trying to finish this off right now."
"Right now, <at>KingJames looks lost. One minute Leonard is on him. The next, it's Diaw. The next, S.A. is collapsing. He doesn't know what 2 do"
"Go 'head <at>KingJames. What a 4th-qt performance. Ginobili has returned to his AWFUL self. If SA loses this game, don't know how they win GM 7"
"OMG!!!!!!!!!! Tony Parker. Sensational. BigTime. What a game. But LeBron isn't done yet!"
"Oh Damn! Bad Turnover by LeBron. Very Bad Turnover. Can't do that in that situation."
"No <at>KingJames. What are you doing. Another bad play. This is unbelievable."
"<at>RealSkipBayless Amen!"
"I'm amazed SA is still in the game, as sloppy as they've played. That....with LBJ, D-Wade and Battier, you would think this is a romp."
"SA looks EXHAUSTED!"
"In case no one has heard, I spoke to <at>DwightHoward directly. No flip-Flopping. He's heading to the Houston Rockets. Still on vaca. C U Sun!"
"Don't be IGNORANT, <at>Antdaddy2009. I did no such thing. I simply said that's what Dwight said he thinks is possible. Lie again? Ur blocked."
"Attention: your boy is back. OFF VACATION. Sportscenter at 11am tomorrow. FIRST TAKE with my man <at>RealSkipBayless on Monday at 10am. HOLLA!"
"Fyi......officially off of vacation a day early. About <url>e on Sportscenter RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I'm so excited about FIRST TAKE tomorrow I honestly don't know what to do w/ myself. For all of you who had withdrawals, keep giving us love"
"<url>ing. And if I'm hyped, can you imagine who hyped <at>RealSkipBayless is? Gonzalez, NFL, NBA Free Agency. We haven't touched it. YET:-)"
"So Buckle Up. I KNOW I speak for <at>RealSkipBayless and myself when I say we're HYPED, RESTED and READY TO ROAR. Then I go to Radio. Lawd!!!!!"
"Damn. AARON HERNANDEZ!!!!!!  I'm all over the place. Sorry. Multi-tasking at a family Bar-B-Que."
"Can't wait to get into NBA Free Agency. So much I've held back. Won't tomorrow on FIRST TAKE, though. You can bet the house on that!"
"Hope y'all enjoyed FIRST TAKE today. Now I'm on ESPN Radio in New York (98.7FM). About to get into Melo and the Knicks. Listen in."
"Melo a long-term lock? Think again! It's all about options, so don't be stunned if he leaves Knicks next July <url>"
"Exactly how many stories will I have to break AHEAD OF TIME <at>MrBottomLine before your sorry <at>$#* gets it? Shut the hell up and watch/listen!"
"That's pathetic, <at>robfallon25. Anytime a Black <url>es on FIRST TAKE, I'm going to <url>plimentary. Sistas need love on TV 4 a change"
"The 76ers should've never given up Jrue Holiday, <at>Kbubs34 . That's a bad boy!"
"<url>ing on Sportscenter.........RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!"
"First Take in the house at the top of the hour. And YES! We will <url>menting on the Trayvon Martin Case. #BuckleUp!"
"For those who did not see today's edition of First Take, <url>"
"FYI......I will be the guest speaker at Salem Baptist Church in Philadelphia tomorrow at 10:30 am. Subject: MANHOOD DAY."
"Haaaaaa!!!!! My episode of ""martin"" and the Love Doctor is on TV ONE right now. Only 15 min left. Please check it out. Haaaaaaa!!!!!!!!"
"For those wanting to hear my speech from yesterday at Salem Baptist, here ya go: <url> Works on Laptops. Phones? Not sure!"
"I simply cannot wait until tomorrow's FIRST TAKE to touch on Ryan Braun. It's rare that I'm aching this much to be on-air. #LordHelpMe!"
"I'm good bruh! How are you?????"
"Just saw the whole incident regarding Eagles' Wideout, Riley Cooper, I'll save <url>ments for FIRST TAKE tomorrow on ESPNEWS -- not ESPN2."
"Coming on Sportscenter LIVE right now to address this Riley Cooper matter. I'll have plenty more time to elaborate in the AM on First Take."
"It's simple, <at>Tommy_Revs. You're obviously lying about speaking to anyone of substance!"
"You're pathetic, <at>Mike_Loveeee. 99 percent of the time I'm talking issues, sports and Black athletes. The second I say a negative word"
"About someone who's not black, ppl like you <at>Mike_Loveeee get all <url>fortable. You do something to black folks we need to know about?"
"Then that would explain why I'm responding to you now, <url>er. Wouldn't it?"
"Hold up! Hold up! Tebow was 1-of-7 for -1 (MINUS 1) YARDS?????????? Haaaa! <at>RealSkipBayless, where the Hell Are You?????????????????????????"
"JESUS! Mark Sanchez throws interception in the end zone. You just can't make this stuff up folks. Ya just can't make this stuff up."
"Vacation or no vacation, <at>Realsk had better speak RESPECTFULLY about my Giants. I'm watching, big boy! I'm watching!"
"I know I'm on vacation, but I saw Braun's apology. It's a FARCE. A Joke. And once again, his weak self is scared to show his face. #PATHETIC"
"Guess who's back! First Take in the house on <url>ing at you RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I'm about to address this Lamar Odom situation for the only time. So if you want to hear, watch FIRST TAKE NOW on ESPN2."
"Kiss my you know what, <url>e talk to me when folks stop exploiting these athletes, then you may have something credible 2 say"
"That might be the stupidest response I've ever heard, <at>Icantwait_SA. If that's what you took out of ALL I said, you're beyond sad, bro!"
"I never called my ppl lazy, <at>whiteprivileged. I just said we're no longer at a pt where we should expect from others. Do for ourselves."
"Folks are looking for me <url>ment on this Manziel situation. All I have to say is 1 thing: I <url>ment on FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 in the AM"
"Well, <url>pletely wrong, <at>jadamoi22. I speak clear English. I can't force you <url>prehend. That's your responsibility."
"Awwwww! I heard the news about Mr. Tebow. My condolences <at>RealSkipBayless. My condolences!"
":-):-):-)"
"My smiles were not meant for <at>TimTebow, who I wish nothing the best to. They were meant for <at>RealSkipBayless for obvious reasons. #relax"
"Mark it down: <at>TimTebow will be in the NFL for years <url>e -- the second he realizes he needs to insist on being whatever works, not a QB"
"The rest of the world may be off, but we're not. FIRST TAKE in the house on <url>ing at you right now."
"Awwwwwwww!!!!!!! I am HYPED. And I here. Right in front of the TV for Alabama/Texas A-M. Rooolllllllllllllll TIDE!!!!!!!!!"
"Damn! Bad enough Manziel is running all over the place. But 'Bama has absolutely, positively no answer for Evans. Not Fulton. No Jones. Damn"
"<at>KDTrey5 He's a BAAAAAADDDDD MAN!"
"What a game. What a damn game!"
"Nick Saban is simply the man. Not because he's 63-3 when leading at the half. It's him pointing out the mental errors, then telling us re:"
"Yeldon's act after the TD: ""That's Just Not Us. That's not who we are. That's not what we do."" A LEADER OF MEN. Plain and Simple."
"Don't think for one second I DON'T believe Manziel will respond. He will. This game will be epic."
"Wow! What a return by Sunseri. What a return. Williams made the play. Manziel probably should not have thrown it. Either way, Manziel 2 Int!"
"Wow! Unbelievable, yet very believable. Haven't enjoyed CFB like this in quite a long time!"
"Pay Skip no mind, folks! <at>RealSkipBayless has already been knocked out and the show hasn't even started yet. Bad weekends will do that 2 ya"
"Man, the Steelers offense is just horrible right now. Can't run. Can't throw. Their defense has done everything to keep them alive. Damn!"
"This might be the most EMBARRASSING DAY I've witnessed as a NY Giants' Fan. What a pathetic, disgraceful performance."
"Btw....watch this BAAAD MAN that is Aaron Rogers pull this game out. He knows I'm watching!"
"Awwwwwwwwwwww Damn!"
"I cannot lie: I'm so ticked off today that I don't know what I'm going to say. FIRST <url>ing at you on ESPN2......RIGHT NOW!!!!!"
"Right now, Sam Bradford looks like Mark Sanchez! Doesn't help that Bowman steam rolls over Richardson and is bulling over everyone, though!"
"Mike Tyson, Jay-Z and Jordan.......all up next on FIRST TAKE on ESPN2. Holla!!!!!"
"Hhhhhaaaaaaaaaa Haaaaaaa!!!!!!!! Tony Romo has over 400 yds passing and 5 TD's...but waits until NOW to throw an INT. Aaaaaaaaa Haaaaaaa!!!"
"ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN! ACCIDENT WAITIING TO HAPPEN! ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN! ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN! ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN!"
":-):-):-)"
"JE-SUS! Matt Schaub! Haaaaaa. You really, really can't make this stuff up. Boy.....I CANNOT WAIT for FIRST TAKE tomorrow morning. Just can't"
"No matter what, give this much to the Jets: Their defense is NOOOOOOO JOKE!!! Atlanta had better wake up. Their season could be in jeopardy."
"That's a HORRIBLE CALL by the officials. Just Horrible. No way in Hell Matt Ryan and the Falcons should've been let off the hook."
"COME ON GENO! You can do it baby! You can do it."
"Geno did his job. No matter the <url>e."
"Haaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!! Happy I'm wrong tonight. Great win by the Jets. By Geno. Be Rex. By Marty. As for the Falcons, they can't be trusted"
"As far as I'm concerned, The Falcons' season is over."
"One helluva game put in Brandon Jacobs. Giants finally had a running game for 1 night."
"I'm not going to lie: I'm flat-out miserable and sick to my stomach over these Giants. Minus-16 on Turnovers this season. Good Lord! #Sick"
"Tom Brady is just unbelievable, man. There's nothing I can say. Just unbelievable. #MyGoodness!"
"Just want to extend my heartfelt Thanks to all those wishing me a Happy 46th Birthday. It's very much appreciated. Love y'all!"
"Oh Shut the hell up, <at>Real_JimBow. Just because I don't believe what you believe doesn't mean I don't KNOW. It means I don't AGREE. #Wakeup!"
"Just wanted to take a moment to reach out and thank Temple U for Hosting me tonight. I had a wonderful time. Hope I touched a few lives."
"I can't believe the Dodgers tonight. How does Kershaw struggle in a moment like this and no visit from the catcher, coach or manager?"
"Congrats to the Cards. One helluva team. Boy do they know how to play some baseball."
"Damn! Florida State is just giving it to Clemson right now. Boyd and the crew haven't shown up. Actually, they're just being outplayed."
"Fla. State is giving Clemson the business tonight. Jameis is ballin. So is FSU's defense. Clemson hasn't shown up and Boyd looks exposed!"
"I'm just sad because I wanted a thrilling game, not a blowout!"
"I know I picked the Colts to win, but I'm not Stupid enough to think Denver having just 14 pts and Welker having just 1 rec 4 3yds will last"
"It's a BEAUTIFUL DAY. My Predictions. FIRST TAKE. <at>RealSkipBayless was wrong. Just beautiful :-)"
"Here is you NEW Madison Square Garden: <url>"
"Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cowboys! What do I continue to say. I'll leave it to y'all to repeat. ""ACCIDENT.........finish sentence"""
"Don't want to hear anything about being a Cowboys' Hater, either. You have the ball w/ under 3 minutes. 2 running plays to Randle. You"
"Played NOT TO LOSE. You didn't play to win. Then you let Durham catch that pass, followed by Megatron RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE! Unbelievable!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is getting really bad. The great Thibs made a mistake allowing Butler and Deng to pick up 3 early fouls. Chicago"
"Hasn't known what to do since. The run is 17-0 right now. Somehow, though, I still suspect Chi-town will make this interesting!"
"Check this out y'all: <url>"
"""Numbers Never Lie is trippin"" with this Kobe prediction”     <url>  "
"Not an empty seat inside the United Center. What a sensational ovation for Derrick Rose."
"Chi/NY game is tight. Love that Woodson has Melo, Hardaway Jr., Shumpert and Felton in the game together. Don't agree with foul vs. Chandler"
"Questionable loose-ball foul called on Joakim Noah. But Tyson Chandler misses FT with 10.8 second left; makes second. Bulls can win it here!"
"Derrick Rose drives right and lofts 1-handed floater over Felton and Chandler with 5.7 second left. Damn! Big-time shot. Good D by Knicks."
"I can't believe the mistakes Brooklyn has made in this last minute. They'd better not lose this game!"
"Please don't bother sending any Kudos my way for yesterday's segment on First Take. Send it all to Robert Smith. He was sensational. #Class!"
"Watching #FixMyLife as we speak. I'm very, very proud of <at>terrellowens. But I've got to admit, this is pretty damn hard to watch. #GodBless"
"It's simply unthinkable to me how any man -- any man -- can know he has a child in this world and simply ignore it. No words for this!"
"But......if <at>terrellowens can forgive this man, who are any of us to judge him. I guess, right? Don't answer."
"I am watching a Pittsburgh Steelers' Defense surrender 48 to a still short-handed  Patriots' squad. Don't tell me this season isn't over!"
"Tomlin has to clean house. Defense is old. Offense is out of sync. When Dobson burns Ike Taylor AND Ryan Clark, what else is there to say?"
"Puh-leeze, <at>dannykanell. Stop it. Think you can stick out your chest b/c of the Raiders if you <url>e on down, get your feelings hurt."
"Buckle up. FIRST TAKE is on the way. Gonna be WILD today!"
"Regarding Incognito: Did I not tell y'all on FIRST TAKE this morning it was <url>ing down?"
"Lawd Have Mercy. I can barely contain myself for tomorrow morning. I might ask <at>RealSkipBayless to take the segment off. Then again...No!"
"FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 tomorrow morning at 10am. Be there! Unless you can't absorb real talk. In that case, don't bother!"
"I saw what the Dolphins had to say regarding Incognito. ESPECIALLY M. Wallace and Cameron Wake. I'll wait for FIRST TAKE to respond! #UGH"
"What is wrong with my New York Knicks? <url>"
"Just watched Glazer's fantastic interview with Incognito. Wow! More layers to this. Feelings have changed. I'll wait FIRST TAKE in the AM!!!"
"Kobe was only left off the list because mJ plays the same position, <at>mttsathletics. Nothing more."
"2 things: Just had a ball speaking at U of South Carolina. Wonderful folks there. Incredible hospitality. Sincere Thanks to you all. And...."
"I've started my new official FACEBOOK page. The address is simply: StephenA. Will use everyday, along with twitter. Looking forward to"
"Talking to you all there. Feel free to follow me on both. Ya never know what I'll say (Smile!!!)"
"Hey Georgia, how about simply allowing the damn ball to be <url>plete or knocking it down. Amazing! All they had to do was leave it alone."
"Haaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!"
"Not true, <at>Hoopsking1968. I just avoid idiots like you.  No analyst is right all the time so I don't lose sleep if/when I'm wrong."
"Hmmm, <at>HorsePlayer504. Let me see: Kareem, Dr. J, Nate ""Tiny"" Archibald. I could go on, but don't have the space nor patience for idiocy."
"I mean, I know I picked the Redskins to lose this game but DAMN! I didn't know they'd look this bad. RG3 looks bad. Shanahan is Done in D.C."
"Oh Lawd, <at>RealSkipBayless is on the war path. Big-time disgusted. Can't blame him, though. FIRST TAKE on ESPN2 at the top of the hour. Holla"
"I know Ridley just fumbled, but I'm telling y'all this Carolina defense looks special. Quick and tenacious. I'm watching! I'm watching!"
"Win, lose or draw, Cam Newton did his job. Big night, Big moment for him."
"On Sportscenter right now. Listen in!"
"FYI: twitter isn't the only place I'll <url>municating from now on. I'll be at Facebook/StephenA. Can't be held to 140 characters anymore:)"
"Shocked, but loving what I'm seeing from the Knicks right now. Their D looks tough. Bargnani is doing his job. Pacers struggling offensively"
"CJ Watson for 3. Now the Knicks are in trouble."
"2 missed wide-open 3's. Knicks lucky, but I'll take it!"
"Mistake by Knicks to let this go to overtime. Melo gets paid to close on that last shot. Sorry!"
"Ladies and Gentlemen: Meet Mr. Paul George. Putting on a Show at MSG."
"Folks are doing it already: you don't like what I say so you're trying to accuse of painting an entire race ""villians"" -- which I DID NOT DO"
"But it's okay because I stand by the content of my words. Keep hating. I'm still here."
"I'm truly sorry you feel that way, <at>RandomColtsFan <at>RealSkipBayless. You have no idea how lucky you are to have Skip and me on the air daily"
"Wow! What a pass from. Phillip Rivers. CB Can't expect safety help on that play. But...what happened to KC's defense? Picked apart today!"
"Btw....let me not fail to give Christian Ponder kudos for a good day. He actually wasn't bad at all. But I still expect the Packers to win."
"Also, I'm loving what I'm seeing from Carolina, but especially Cam. Didn't seem fazed down 16-3 at all. Cool and Calm. Impressive!"
"I don't like the way the Giants are looking at all."
"I like Ridley a lot, but if I'm Belichick I bench that man. Just too. Many fumbles, man."
"Btw.....congrats to the cowboys......as SICKENING as that is for me to say."
"Damn! Here we all were looking for a Brady/manning matchup, but Ridley AND Blount can't hold onto the football. Damn Shame!"
"Thank You"
"New York Sports stink right now. That's right, I said it: <url>"
"That's not the point, damnit, <at>wassupMikey. That's that stupic <at>#*<at> I can't stand: UNTIL it's legal, IT AIN'T! Don't blow your damn money!"
"What the hell is so hard for you to understand, <at>wassupMikey? You wanna go out and encourage dudes to lose $$$ just so they can weed up?"
"That's that IGNORANT <at>#*<at> that serves to keep us down, <at>wassupMikey. And it's ppl like you fostering it. #DamnShame!"
"Want to take a moment to wish each and everyone of you a lovely and Happy Thanksgiving. We're all Blessed. Great day to remember that!"
"I've tried long enough to be. Cool, but I'm officially concerned about Kidd and the Nets. Houston is STOMPING them right now. #GodAwful!"
"2 min left in game and the Wizards don't even have 70 vs. Pacers. I like John Wall, but he might need to be quiet until his team gets better"
"The Knicks are trailing at the hald in Denver, shooting 9 percent from 3-pt range. Damn! When is my misery going to end with these dudes?"
"Went back to Nets/Rockets Game. Bad news is Rockets have hit 18 3's. Good news is that Nets are only down by 24. #MoralVictories(Ugh!)"
"Rockets had 31 assists on 39 made baskets. Did what they wanted to do."
"Good to see Jrue Holiday back in Philly. 20 pts, 13 assists. Just saw him hug Jason Richardson. Forget JR was still in the league (injuries)"
"Serge Ibaka....5 blocks vs. SA last game, 4 this game. He patrols the paint like that and KD and RW stay healthy, look out San Antonio."
"Big-time move by Harrison Barnes. Mark Jackson told me he was gonna make even more noise this season. He's got a career-high 26. I like it!"
"Wow! Big-time turn-around 3-pt by Westbrook with 1/10th of a second left. OKC 113-112 lead. Wow!"
"Isiah Thomas just made a very valid point about Westbrook: ""He takes his matchups PERSONAL."" Very true. RW is a Rebel."
"Good lawd. JR, shitty turnaround shot. Just awful. And Randy Foye followed up with a 3. Denver up 94-85 with 1:43 left. #DamnDamnDamn!"
"Damnit Foster. I haven't seen too many FG hooks like that bad, but that wasn't a damn False Start penalty on Alabama. Bogus call."
"Look! I wasn't saying he didn't flinch. I'm saying that's a Bogus rule. What are you gonna penalize him for next? Passing Gas. #GoodLord!"
"What the hell is going on! A punter's gonna be the MVP now (Clark)? This is making me depressed already. <at>RealSkipBayless is smiling. Damn!"
"Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!McCarron to Cooper. 99 Yards! Haaaa!!!!!"
"Yyyeeeeaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Who the hell do y'all think y'all are going for it on 4th-and-inches against Bama. Way to do your job Hubbard!"
"RRRRRROOOOLLLLLLLLLLLlLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL"
"TTTTTTIIIIIIDDDDEEEEE!!!!!!!"
"Damn! Damn! I'm so done with this dude Cade Foster. He did everything but kick it into his OL's backside! No wonder the block. #DonewithHim"
"Mother Hubbard! Damn!"
"Btw....as an aside before OT, what the hell was coach Hoke thinking. Who cares that his PLAYERS wanted to go for 2-pt conv? He's the coach!"
"No <at>#*#*<at>$<at>$* way!"
"Unbelievable!"
"Gotta admit, great way for it to end though. <at>RealSkipBayless was right. Give Skip his props. Called it. Said something divine would occur."
"A rarity, but Saban dropped the ball. Didn't have a single athlete on the field for coverage. Was totally unprepared for a 57-yard missed FG"
"And Btw.......the way that FG missed, Griffith should've kicked the previous two Field Goals."
"Awful Awful day for Alabama. They lose a shot at the Nat'l Championship and probably the Heisman (McCarron) too. Devastating!"
"Ii like what I'm seeing from Houston in this Rockets/Spurs' Game. Especially from Terrence Jones. Spreads the floor. Makes Houston's offense"
"Real nice pass from Ginobli to Belinelli. I tell ya, SA passes like crazy and Belinelli seems to be THE perfect fit. Could win it all."
"Testing from my iPhone. Testing from my iPhone"
"I'm sorry, <at>BrendaLarbre. Do you see me on First Take on a Saturday or Sunday? Wait until Monday please!"
"I'm telling you, man, I don't know about this dude Milliner. Bad enough he's struggled with coverage all season, but now you can't tackle?"
"And by the way, what the hell was I thinking in picking the Cardinals. My bad. Forgot all about Carson Palmer. Pathetic performance today."
"And now Gould misses a 47-Yarder for Chicago. Does anyone want to win this damn game in Minnesota."
"Switched to a little b-ball. Gotta admit: watching Clips/Pacers. B. Griffin is NOT backing down from West at all. Good battle. If he can be"
"Manning and Decker should be ARRESTED! What they're doing to the rookie (Cooper) is criminal. Beyond Cruel and unusual punishment. Damn!"
"I cannot believe how many passes KC has dropped today. I've counted 5 in the 3rd QT, alone. Jenkins! Avery! Can't blame Alex Smith for this!"
"Yes. We're ALWAYS READY. First Take in the <url>ing at ya on ESPN2. We're here."
"My apologies for saying on First Take that the Knicks were winless in November. I mean Winless AT HOME! Then again, does it really matter!"
"So much for my damn prediction. I can barely hear with all that noise in Seattle, so  imagine how it is for N.O."
"This is freakin embarrassing. Game over and the first quarter hasn't even ended. I thought I was watching Seattle vs. N.O. -- not the Jets!"
"Okay now! Maybe we will have a game afterall."
"I'm sitting here going back-and-forth watching Heat/Pistons, Nets/Nuggets. What. A HIDEOUS damn performance from Brooklyn. Just Awful!"
"SHOWTIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First Take in the house......RIGHT NOW!!!!! On ESPN2!"
"Thank you, My. Lord, for giving us Nelson Mandela. Rest in eternal peace!"
"Man, I just left the Knicks Game. What a beatdown. Woodson survives. Melo thrives and the Nets have regressed to a new form of Ugly. Damn!"
"Btw...we'll be discussing famous Jameis on First Take in the AM. I'll wait until then to go ""Primetime"" on Skip and anyone else."
"Once said Melo told me anything because he did not. Melo will say he wants to stay a Knick until he's out the door, as he should."
"Haaaaaa!! I'm just going home from Knicks/Nets. Just turned on the TV. RIGHT IN TIME to witness Shaub's game-deciding INT. #Cannotmakethisup"
"Thank you for the kind words, <at>MtgRecruiter. So thoughtful of you to say!"
"Their behavior was beyond inappropriate. It was disgustingly blase. And anyone who thinks otherwise about that presentation can KICK ROCKS!"
"What the hell is going on? Where is THE OHIO STATE? Did they forget a trip to the Nat'l Championship is on the line!"
"Big-time stop by MSU on that 4th down. But I've gotta say, Meyer has been somewhat predictable this entire half."
"Oh my goodness. Langford for the TD with 2:16 left. OSU's about to go down. Where's thee 5th ranked rushing defense? Damn. MSU is rolling!"
"Ohio State has 13 total yards in the 4th Quarter this far. Disgraceful!"
"The SEC will play for a Nat'l title....AGAIN!"
"This is exactly what infuriates folks about the Lions. How can Stafford and his center make such a mistake on the snap? Simply no discipline"
"Btw.....pleased with Geno and the Jets today. Even if it is vs. the Raiders"
"I swear to Goodness, in aall my years of watching NFL, I've never -- ever -- seen an ending like these last 2 min of Ravens/Vikings."
"Another potentially great finish: Pats/browns!"
"Apologies to those who received retweet from <at>Seanhannity about the Jets. Now he's got y'all thinking they'll make the playoffs. #Not"
"Note: don't think for one second I forgot about my Knicks. I'll deal with them tomorrow morning"
"<at>FunnyPicsDepot Man, this tweet was funny as hell. Gotta admit, I was cracking up when I saw it. It's what I'm thinking of 1/2 time w/ Skip."
"Wishing and striving everyday to be a better spiritual son. Still hope for me yet :-)"
"HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS???"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the 1st QT. Is not even over yet and the Knicks are down by 16 (25-9). My God!!!"
"Right now <at>RealSkipBayless looks like a prophet. <url>posed Miami is outplaying an emotional Pacers' squad. Indy needs to calm down. #Relax"
"Listening to my boy, Greg Anthony. He's absolutely correct: Paul George was worse player for Indy in 1st 1/2. Wasn't ready to play vs LeBron"
"Uh oh! Paul George is starting to feel it now. Back-to-Back 3's."
"While Paul george puts on a show, I switch to the Knicks' game and see Coach Woodson looking as if he's on the verge of tears. #SoBadNY!"
"Kyrie Irving's Line: 37, 11 and 1 TO. I know the boy is nice, but is that about HIM, or more about Felton and Pablo? Just a question! Damn!"
"I meant mini-run by George. Hibbert's been the man for Indy tonight!"
"An airball by <at>KingJames with 51.8 left. Would've made score 86-84. Forced it, though. Didn't need that!"
"You might be the silliest human being alive, <at>CheyenneTweets. I'm always invited to THE parties. And I turn them down most times.#ignorance"
"FYI.....En route to LA. Will be on the Arsenio Hall Show tomorrow night. Holla at y'all later"
"Just reached 1.6 million followers. Wanted to take a moment to SINCERELY thank all of y'all for the love and support. Keep <url>ing."
"Btw.....please don't forget I've got a Facebook account now. It's <url> I've got more than 140 characters to make noise:-)"
"Watchj your damn mouth, <at>Flacco4Prez. And don't talk about my boy  <at>RyanRuocco like that or you'll be blocked."
"Hello, <at>MaMcCleary. What part of 'GO READ MY FACEBOOK PAGE did you not understand?"
"For a day, even for a few hours, it's okay to ALLOW yourself to be Happy. Just finished taping the Arsenio Hall Show. Love it.#Humbled"
"Hope y'all enjoyed me on <at>ArsenioHall last night. I haven't seen it yet, but I appreciate all the love folks are showing me."
"This weather is treacherous, y'all. NJ Turnpike looks like a death trap. Gotta be safe. Wish me luck"
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!How 'Bout them Cowboys!!!"
"HOW 'BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!! Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"One more message for everyone, but Especially the <url>munity. It's posted at <url> It needed to be said. Take a look."
"My latest column on the Knicks. Brace yourself:<url>"
"That's such a damn lie, <at>SolomonSyed. That is not what I said!"
"My lesson for the day: don't waste my time fending off lies about what I say. Ppl lie on purpose to get attention. Stupid to give it to them"
"See, this is exactly why the Pacers are so tough. Not making shots, def breakdowns and on the road, and they still have an 11-10 lead."
"They're not backing down. They want this matchup all day long, win, lose or draw! Conference Finals Matchup inevitable. <url>eAlive"
"I really need to start giving Lance Stephenson some more love. Damn, his game has improved. Handle. Jumpshot, etc.! Very impressive."
"Heat look out-of-sync, outmuscled and <url>bobulated. Plus they're missing FT's. They lose this game and Pacers' confidence will blow up!"
"Good defense with Miami there. If Indiana doesn't stop turning ball over, they may need to do EVERYTHING they can to get Rondo."
"Bigtime jam by LeBron. Making it a 5-pt deficit. 16-6 run by Miami. Whew! It's about to get real up in here."
"LeBron: injured, 8-for-13, hitting 3's, defending and doing it all. So much for <at>RealSkipBayless getting on <at>KingJames"
"I believe <at>KingJames. Everyone respects <at>mchalmers15. How can you not? If I felt differently, damnit I'd say so!"
"Ya got me good big boy, <at>Hoya2aPacer. Payback's a you know what :-)"
"Amen brother <at>DeionSanders . Amen!"
"My apologies to a bunch of folks who think I'm following them when I'm not. My new phone has gone berserk and it's doing that. Not Me!"
"Haaaa! What up homie!"
"To all my Cowboys' Haters out there, don't sweat. This win is the PERFECT SETUP to a heartbreaker next week. Don't you worry 'bout a thing:)"
"Amen my man, <at>richeisen. Amen!"
"My God, where are the Bears' pride? Where's their dignity? Just because GB and Detroit lose you go to Philly and lay this egg? #LostRespect"
"I'll be there my man, <at>RealSkipBayless. Don't you worry!"
"Buckle up! First Take in the House. <at>RealSkipBayless thinks he has me. He'd better ask somebody!"
"Leave it to one of the NY Teams to tarnish Christmas. The Nets look awful today. Just awful. No way else to put it! Feel sorry for my man BK"
"Hope Paul Pierce sticks around and man's up by answering questions. Still, feel sorry for him and KG. Champions like those 2 deserve better!"
"Merry Christmas Bro, <at>JalenRose. To you and the whole Countdown Crew! Keep Pushing!"
"Well, I guess that means the Knicks will lose by 40 instead of 30, huh,<at>SportsCenter. #MerryChristmas"
"Knicks Game. 1st Possession: Turnover by Beno. Jumper from Durant. Right now I'm wondering if the Knicks will lose by 50. Seriously!"
"Okay. I'm going to stop. It REFUSE to be this agitated on Christmas Day. I just Refuse!"
"Chance favors the prepared mind. Be ready to claim <url>es your way before someone does it 4 you. Then bitterness arises. Don't allow it."
"For those who didn't catch that, it was my way of saying Happy New Year. Meaning be ready to make the New Year a Happy One."
"CP3. Damn this boy is special. Single-handedly carrying the Clips right now. BG is doing well, too, though but Portland is tough as hell"
"See, this is why Portland is so dangerous. They're tall, which means they cause matchup problems for everyone. But are also lethal on 3's"
"Greg Hardy and Carolina's front-7 are doing their thing vs. Atlanta. Panthers get the No .2 seed, then NFC playoff pic gets interesting"
"It is absolutely unbelievable to me that the Chargers are blowing this opportunity w / playoffs on the line. KC beating then w/ backups!"
"Great catch by Brandon Marshall. Bigtime"
"Like I said peeps: just relax. Rodgers has GOT this. Just chill out"
"Loving this:  3 great games on at the same time: KC/SD, chi/GB, and Ari/SF"
"Aaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!! He 's a bbbaaaaddddd man!!! Awwwwwww. How ya like that. <at>RealSkipBayless . Haaaaa!!!"
"No matter what happens, Rodgers is not responsible for the Packers' Defense. This is on them"
"Aaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!. He's a Baaaddd Baaadddd Man. Cutler? Not so much! Haaaaaaa"
"What a great catch by this kid/rookie Patton of San Fran just now. He's the one who set up that 56-harder game-winner."
"Now I'm getting ticked off. The Eagles are making this game far more interesting than it needs to be <url>e on , Man!"
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
Accident Waiting To Happen. How 'Bout Them Cowboys!  Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Sincerely , from my heart, my condolences to <at>KingJames, Kenyon Martin of the Knicks, and all if CowboysNation out there. #SIKE (Haaaaaaa)"
"First Take abut to close out the year with ya live. Oh, btw.....How 'Bout then Cowboys!!! (Haaaaa!)"
"Yes sir"
"Amen"
"Cade Foster......again! Damn!"
"Still the 2nd Half to go. Alabama looks like they don't even want to be here. No Nat'l Title? Why bother!"
"Big-Time 3 by Deron Williams to give Nets 91-89 lead over OKC. Nice pass from Livingston, too. I like! I like!"
"Another big-time move by D. Will"
"18 points sine halftime by D-Will. This is what the Hell he's suppose to be doing. It 's what Nets' fans have waited for."
"Btw.....I saw what Steph Curry did to Miami tonight"
"Yeeeaaahhhhhh! Joe Johnson rainbow jumper over Ibaka for the win as the buzzer sounds. This is what he does. If D-Will plays like again....."
"Melo ties it"
"Yeeaaahhhh!!!!! Iman Shumpert with a big-time 3 from the left-wing. Knicks lead 101-98. Shumpert's got 25. Yeeeaaahhhhhh!"
"Knicks give up 3 from top of Key to Bellinelli over Melo. (Who was picked) with 37 sec left. Damn! Damn! Damn! Score tied at 101. $&<at>&)<at>"
"Whoaaaaaa!!!! Sky-walking tip-follow by Shumpert off a Melo miss with 23 sec left. Shumpert has a career-high 27pts folks. Knicks 103-101"
"Yyyeeeaaaahhhhhhh!!! Knicks pull it out 105-101. 1st win of the year vs. Western Conference team. Yeeeaaahhhhh"
"Sweet, Sweet pass to Bester over Jackson. Okla. Doing it's thing"
"Nice TD pass from Knight to Shepard, too . Looked like Montana to Clarke. But I gotta say this: never thought I'd see Bama D look THIS bad!"
"Bama gave up 10 sacks all season, and now 6 in one game. Good Lord"
"One other thing I noticed: McCarron can't scramble vs. this defense. His stock has been hurt Bigtime in his last 2 collegiate games."
"This Kid Henry is either a Bigtime player or Okla's run defense stinks"
"Time to give Okla it's props. Tremendous speed by Striker. Bama' off. Line had a very bad night. Saban 'a got to address that D next season"
"Striker was absolutely right in what he said, <at>Grayson_S <at>RealSkipBayless. I didn't think OKLA. had a chance in hell. I was WRONG. Congrats"
"This might be the worst ,'most uninspired I've seen from Indy since Luck arrived"
"90-yard, 12-play drive. Now we have a game. A 38-10 cushion by KC is now 41-38 KC. Wow!"
"This is absolutely unbelievable. What <url>eback. Luck is a baaaaaadddd young man. And Hilton isn't shabby, eithr"
"Typical Cincy. Never show up when it's time. As for Marvin Lewis: 11 seasons and not a single playoff victory. Enough's Enough. Goodbye!"
"B.S. I know Dalton stinks when it counts most,  but I need a coach who can figure out how to remedy that over the course of 11 years.  Sorry"
"I don't care about folks ""comfort"" <at>GarnerBussell. I care about truth and justice. That's the only way to make the world a better place"
"On my damn: Nick Marshall is elusive, plus he's made a couple of nice throws. Okay! Okay! Still think the Seminoles will crush. #TitleTalk"
"Auburn's a bit surprising here. Definitely expected them to run more earlier. #TitleTalk"
"Awwwwww Damn! #TitleTalk"
"Def. Front for Auburn getting penetration. FSU needs to nip this in the bud right now . #TitleTalk"
"What in the hell is going on? Damn. Auburn's defense looks hellacious. #TitleTalk"
"Oops. Mistake by Auburn. Riffing the punter. Could be a momentum shifter. # TitleTalk"
"To be real, right now I do not see that smile on Famous Jameis' face. Auburn's D <url>e to play. Game will be decided up front. #TitleTalk"
"These FSU receivers are getting 1-on-1 coverage and can't do anything. What's up with Benjamin? #TitleTalk"
"This is not looking good for FSU. Auburn's starting to seem like it can do what it wants. I'm going to talke a break. #TitleTalk"
"I'm not going to front: the way Auburn is balling, it looks like the SEC is exposing the ACC. Damn, looking like I got juked! #TitleTalk"
"Damn. 1-total yard on last 13 offensive plays. #TitleTalk"
"Can't put this on Zjameis right now. Off. Line getting pushed around. Receivers not getting open. Auburn simply looks ready. #TitleTalk"
"Damn! Damn! Damn!, Winston. Hold onto the ball, man. #TitleTalk"
"That drive was all Jameis. Let's see if we finally have a game here. #TitleTalk"

"Folks need to calm the hell down. Nobody's knocking Peyton this way. I'm just acknowledging that others will if all he has is 1 SB. Simple!"
"Stop annoying me by acting like you don't understand my words, misinterpreting what I'm saying. Folks are not stupid. You know what I said."
"In no way did I disrespect Trent Dilfer. He's my colleague and someone I respect. I was just saying he wasn't - like others -- is not Peyton"
"Oh my goodness , I'm starting to get excited. My Knicks might pull this off, especially the way Shumpert is playing. Yeah ! Yeah! Yeah!"
"Big time shot by Felton. 4 min to <url>e on Knicks!!!"
"Felton again. Yes!!!!!"
"Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! Melo for 3 ! From Felton"

"Awwwwwwww. Stay with the slam . And what a game from Felton. 14 assists. Yes!!!!!!"

"Good Lawd. Who the hell is Blount ? Jim Brown or Earl Campbell? Jesus!"
"Loved that Carolina went for it, but a QB dice was not the right call. Gotta have more momentum in that dituatin"
"Beautiful throw by Cam. Beautiful catch by the man with the best name in the NFL (Steve Smith). I'm worries about SF with how Kap looks."
"Can't even front: do far Cam just looks unstoppable and Carolina looks like the better team. Simple and plain. Taking too many hits, though."
"What an absolute B.S. call (roughing the passer) vs. Smith in that sack on Cam. No freaking way should that have been called."

"It's early but it's not looking good for Denver right now."
"Big-time pass by Wilson to Baldwin"
"Manning gets intercepted. Denver is without a first down for the entire 1st QT. Houston, we have a problem. It's the Seahawks!"
"What the hell is this : ET calling home? Manning is on the phone, looking like he's calling for help. Denver <url>pletely rattled. Damn!"
"This is unreal. This could really get ugly for Denver. Real ugly. What's up Manning! What's up!!!!"

"It's over!"
"This might end up being the biggest blowout in Super Bowl History, the way things are looking right now ."
"Btw....these <url>mercials are terrible. Not moved by any of them. Can I get just 1 funny one, please. Lawdy! Now back to Football"
"Can't front. I am in a state of shock. Manning shut down. <url>pletely outclassed, outcoached, out-muscled. Just unbelievable."

"This is so bad......I may call in sick!"
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but Bruno is turning this out. I can't believe how entertaining this is. This boy is talented."
"This ain't even a game anymore. The only intrigue left is whether or not Manning-and-Co will score. Nothing else."
"This is so embarrassing. Broncos have been totally punked. SB Sunday ruined. It's so bad, next season won't mean anything re: Denver! Why?"
"No matter what Denver does next season we'll remember this beatdown and say: ""Screw Them! We know who they really are."""
"And btw....... If Peyton Manning gets SHUT OUT in this game, no need for anymore talk about him over Montana, Brady, etc."
"Not only was I wrong about  my pick, I actually don't blame folks for wondering what <at>TimTebow would do."
"Denver scores. Congratulations"
"Btw.....there's something wrong when the <url>mercial thus far is the free one by the NFL. What happened to the fun? The laughter?"

"There's nothing to talk about. Marcus Smart should be suspended 3-to-5 games. A college athlete has no business putting his hands on a fan."
"Especially a middle-aged man. Marcus Smart, by all accounts, is a good kid who made a mistake. He should be allowed to recover from this."
"BUT....you don't do what he did. It can't be allowed. It's not just about Smart. It's about sending the message that such behavior won't fly"
"Correct <at>JGeewentworth. And the fan should be dealt with Harshly. But that doesn't excuse Marcus. He could've called an official or someone."
"Good Lord, can I get an AMEN on that <at>gilkesc1. That's what I 'm saying"
"Only person that's sad is you, <at>thaflight. You're reacting emotionally, thinking of justifying things instead of realizing impact of actiobs"

"I'm done. I'm just done. With the Knicks, and especially with Felton right now. This season is a mess. I'm just depressed"
"Bottom line: the Knicks couldn't get stops either. No effort resembling the 1st half. They're just finding ways to lose games. #Damn!"
"Man,  don't even get me started"
"Haaaaaaaa! I wish"
"How in the Hell does Prigioni leave Mike Miller -- of all people -- open? How?"

"Somebody has to"
"Marc Stein is on the air telling is Shumpert could traded to OKC for a 1st Rounder. I don't want to lose him. But what choice does NY have ?"
"I know it's only the 1st Half but I'm very disappointed on Durant. How do you go the 1st 6 min w/o taking a shot in THIS game. #2ndPlace"
"Durant has picked a fine time to put forth his worse game of the season. This is unbelievable. I haven't seen him like this all year long"
"OKC, collectively, looks God Awful. No fight. Just folding. But <at>KingJames is DESTROYING them. I really can't say anything else right now."
"No flow at all from OKC. And don't blame it on Westbrook because he's not even in the game. Just jacking up shots. 1-on-1 ball."
"What in the Hell is up? OKC bouncing balls off their feet, running NO plays, <url>pletely lost. What a Horrible performance. Meanwhole"
"Miami looks pretty close to flawless. LeBron's hitting shots. So is D-Wade. Ray Allen, Chris Bosh. This is the Finals from 2 yrs ago. #Damn"
"So much for intrigue. If OKC doesn't march <url>eback, y'all gonna have me crying for the Spurs to be back in the Finals."
"Okay ! We'll attribute it to rust and a lack of practice time, because I truly have never seen OKC look this bad. Out if sync. Miami Defense"
"Kudos to Allan Hahn and Walky Szczerbiak for doing the Knicks Post-Game Show. This team stinks, but they still break it down w/ interest."
"I'm so damn disgusted I don't know what to do w/ myself. Orl averages 96 in regulation, but had 106. Oladipo damn near has a triple-double."
"Orl basically got on their knees and begged Felton to shoot. Oladipo got to front of the run at will. And they waste 44-and-11 by Melo."
"I'm so damn done with this team I may start taking Prozac. Good Lawd somebody help me. Help strip me if my love for this team.#BrokenHeart"

"Or. <at>Realrclark25, to be exact. Damnit, my man on a First Take right now who plays for the Steelers."
"What do you folks want me to say? That the Knicks stink? That they've ruined B-Ball for me this season. That Melo will say Kick rocks? What!"
"I'm sick. I'm nauseated! I'm embarrassed. I'm furious, depressed, miserable, exhausted and totally DONE with the Knicks right now. Damn!"
"So I wake up, turn on the TV and the 1st thing I see is Raymond Felton arrested on gun charges. 2 Felony Counts. Good Goodness. #Betrayal"
"I'm talking betrayal to Mike Woodson. JR starts the season in trouble. T. Chandler sounded off. Now this. How does that make Woodson look."
"Oh, and I just heard Boeheim call out Md. ""if they didn't turn the ball over 18 times, they wouldn't have to worry about that. #Damn!"
"For those of who wanted to hear my Black History Month special from last Saturday; sp<url>"
"I've done no such thing, <at>waytiz <at>RFeltonGBMS. The more I hear about this Felton matter, the more questions I have. And not about Felton."
"Why.  What's happening?"
"Knicks! Sickening. Ruining my vacation as we speak. Will never understand why I let them do this to me. I must be whipped!"
"Amen!"
"On my vacation, I still showed up for THIS Knicks' game. That's all that needs to be said. #Stupidandgluttenforpunishment."
"Six minutes into the game and the Knicks are already down 23-4. Good Lord. I just cannot believe this. I just can't."
"No worries ,ppl. I saw <at>KingJames performance tonight, as well as the Knicks. I'll be on SPORTSCENTER with Stuart Scott in the next hour!"
"Finally, I've figured out what's wrong with my Knicks. I know who's to blame. I'll announce WHO tomorrow w/ <at>RyanRuocco on ESPN Radio NY."
"I'm so confident no one will figure out who I'm talking about, I will treat whoever guesses to 2 tix to a Nets or Knicks game b4 season ends"
"I told y'all I'd reveal who's to blame for the Knicks woes this season. Check out what I said on ESPN Radio NY: <url>"
"The Knicks have reached out to Phil Jackson. Why, exactly? <at>RyanRuocco and I will discuss it on ESPN Radio NY (98.7FM) live at top of hour."
"Sitting here watching this Kansas/WVA game . Wiggins athleticism is off the charts , but he still isn't Parker. And I'm loving Staten 4 WVA."
"I can't believe Angulo is still standing after the shots he's taking from Canelo. But I also can't believe Canelo is allowing this slow dude"
"To touch him. Canelo does not need to take shots from this dude , although Angulo isn't getting leverage on any of his shots."
"Canelo looks like he's getting stalked. Angulo <url>ing and Canelo, although having won every round, seems like he's slowing down."
"Angulo is loaded with heart , but isn't that smart . He's chasing/following , but not cutting off the rim ."
"Wow! Round 8. Canelo taking shots. Talking smack, throwing back. If he can truly handle that heat, no one can touch him but Floyd."
"Good body and head movement by Canelo. His defense has improved tremendously. He keeps this up , Cotto's next. Then rematch vs. Floyd. #Must"
"Fight stopped. Terrie stoppage. Should not have been stopped. Angulo was taking shots but still standing and swinging. Had not been down."
"Wrong judgement call by ref. No warning. No anything. Wrong decision. Just flat- out wrong"
"I'm not saying Canelo would beat Floyd. I'm simply saying he'd beat anybody else which will force a rematch since he'd be the best out there"
"Like I said, <at>KDTrey5 is in the lead for league-MVP honors. 42pts tonight. On Houston. Love the hostility b/t Westbrook & Beverly, too."

"If the Shockers are gonna win this game they will need to contain Harrison. Because VanVleet isn't going to do it for you."
"Kentucky is younger, bigger, quicker, more athletic. So why am I still feeling like the Shockers will win this game?"
"This kid Early is an NBA talent. But Randle, no matter how young, how raw, could be a star. That size with that handle,....nice! Great Game!"
"This is the best college game I've seen all year. My man Greg Anthony is doing an outstanding job calling this game. A heavyweight for sure"
"Kentucky freshmen showing me something. Big shots. Big free throws."
"Don't know if I like a timeout here. But coach Marshall is good at this so we 'll see"
"Great game. Terrific play by Kentucky. Only reservation: Baker or Early has to find a way to get their hands on the ball in that situation."
"For those always saying they're looking for me -- I'm not hard to find. Right now on ESPN Radio (NY) 98.7FM from 1-3pm. 800.919.3776. Holla"

"Are y'all listening to Steve Smith break down these Knicks? Saying there's no trust, <url>munication on D? Damn! They can't even do that !"
"Lakers getting nothing but wide open shots. No one in the vicinity. This is so damn disgusting. So embarrassing . So oh to hell with it!"
"The Lakers have 101 points in 3 quarters . 101 points ladies and gentlemen . #JESUS"

"<url>es Wisconsin"
"<url>posure by Wisconsin . Great play on the back pick for Jackson. Biggest thing: Wisconsin begging KY to shoot J's. Begging them!"
"Let me say this: if you can't make a wide-open jumper near the free throw line, you don't deserve to win this game."
"<url>es back in the game. KY's problems from the perimeter resolved!"
"Lord Have Mercy. What a dunk by Poytress"
"Great play by Jackson.....knowing the shot clock. Got away with a travel, but still smart to draw that foul on a young Andrew Harrison."
"Love to see the son (Jackson) of my boy, Jim Jackson, doing good things."
"Aaron Harrison.....again! Defender laid off. Didn't press up. Unbelievable. But there's still 5.7 left"
"Hey <at>RealSkipBayless you ready to find out whether you're right about those Huskies? Still time to change your prediction"
"Don't like what I'm seeing from Kentucky right now. UConn creating turnovers. KY can't seem to handle their pressure."
"Guard play, Guard play, Guard play. Looking good right now. <at>RealSkipBayless."
"My goodness. Everything one of the Harrison's drive , they're getting stripped. Get the ball to Randle"
"Kentucky has no answer for Napier. He looks like he can do what he wants, and knows it. Wow! KY's best hope is to get it to Randle down low."
"I've rarely seen Calipari looking this helpless. KY totally rattled. Can't hold onto the ball."
"I cannot believe this. KY can't drive. Can't hold into the ball. This might be a blowout if they don't get their act together fast"
"Look damnit, put a Box-and-1 on Napier. Deny him the ball. Don't let him shoot. Whatever it takes. Mug the damn man if you have to. JESUS!!!"
"It's a miracle Kentucky isn't down by 20 at the break. I'll admit that much <at>RealSkipBayless. Gotta say, I love Ollie saying what he said at"
"The half. ""We're a second-half team too. No backing down. Love his attitude."
"There's no way Kentucky is winning this Nat'l Championship with Julius Randle taking just 3 shots. #Blasphemy"
"Smart of Ollie to delay UConn's pressure . He knows he can't rely on his bench in the second half. He's saving Napier for the end"
"Flop damnit. Flop. Terrible call vs. Poytress"
"Kentucky literally throwing away this game."
"UNTIL that Dunk by Young. Wow!!"
"Good point <at>RealSkipBayless. I can't deny that. But your boys are still losing. Haven 'to had a lead yet"
"Why can't college kids have jump ball"
"And how many damn times do I have to say get the ball away from Napier. Let anyone else beat you"
"Btw....in case anyone hasn't noticed, anyone feeling the need to cuss or call me out my name is instantly blocked. Grow up. Let's talk ball."
"13-of-23 from Free Throw line. If Kentucky loses this game , that'll be a big reason why. But I'll give Napier and Boatright most of credit."
"Yo <at>RealSkipBayless I told you this <url>e down to the wire. We'll see who shows up."
"Someone should kidnap Napier right now. Tie his shoelaces together. Spike his drink, his towel. Something! Just don't let him shoot"
"Kentucky blew this in the last minute if this game. Sorry, but they didn't seem prepared. They just didn't"
"Congrats <at>RealSkipBayless. Ya got this one"
"Congrats to my man Kevin Ollie, too. Well-deserved. My bad. Never , ever, bet against superior guard play. Randle barely had the ball."
"This book is what contributed to me losing 13 lbs of belly fat. I may have a chance at a six-pack someday afterall. (Haaaaa)"

"<at>KingJames is rolling right now. Indy looks utterly helpless."

"Pacman wins easy. My final score: 116-112. Bradley punched himself out. Fatigued last 6 rounds. Definitely Pacman"
"My absolute favorite player in the NBA, Steph Curry, is putting on a show.....again. The kid is simply special y'all. Just special."

"Will the Grizzlies hold on?"
"Hello! Test!"
"Hello! Test. Test."
"Test! Test! Test!"
"Thanks y'all. My twitter has been down for the last week. I could read everything, but couldn't send for the most part. Very weird"
"Just having fun with my man <at>BunBTrillOG and <at>DwightHoward. All love and fun fellas."
"What a game in Toronto <at>RyanRuocco. What a game my man!"
"My apologies to everyone for being off First Take and Radio today. Bronchitis/Sinus Infection shut me down peeps. But ONLY for today."
"I shall return tomorrow to be with my boys <at>RealSkipBayless (TV) and <at>RyanRuocco (Radio). It's killing me not to be on after the games I saw"
"Love my man Ryan Clark. Proud of how he's filling in for me today. But he's insane if he thinks Dallas won't win another game.#Skipwinked!"
"My sincere apologies to my teammates <at>RealSkipBayless, <at>CariChampion & <at>ESPN_FirstTake crew. Really thought I'd be back 2day.#DamnBronchitis"
"My apologies to all the fans of the show as well. Trust when I tell you you have NO IDEA how badly I wish I was working the last 2 days."
"Hey, just because I can't talk doesn't mean I can't debate <at>RealSkipBayless. Let's all watch the show together. I'll tweet all show long."
"<at>RealSkipBayless had better be respectful. I'm watching, waiting!"
"Ooooohhhh! Shots fired! Okay. Okay"
"Very happy to see <url>e to his senses about CP3. The call could've went either way, but it happens. Clips deserved the win."
"Bruce Bowen just needs <url>e out and admit he's fading away from the Spurs and is starting to feel the Clippers. I know I'm feeling them."
"Btw......thanks to my boys Ryan Clark (yesterday) and Bruce Bowen (today) for looking out for me, filling in. Much appreciated fellas"
"Bruce and <at>RealSkipBayless can say what they want, but <url>es down to <at>KDTrey5 being that dude. At this stage, it's about WILL. Are you"
"Going to allow your team to lose. We all know how tough Memphis is. We also know when <at>KDTrey5 is assertive, few can stop them#Takeover"
"I know you better stop being SO DISRESPECTFUL <at>RealSkipBayless. Remember, I shall return"
"I disagree with <at>LegsESPN about the Pacers for the moment. Game 4 is clearly their season, but if they win that game Indy is still good"
"I do agree with <at>RealSkipBayless about having never seen a No.1 seed plummet like this. I agree with him about Paul George, too."
"I'll say this: Frank Vogel can't just sit there any longer deferring to their regular season wins. Can't just sit there with status quo."
"For the first time since I've been with <at>ESPN_FirstTake, I'm humbled by who's sitting in my seat: The great Jon Gruden. Honored sir!"
"I'm all in coach Gruden. Whatever you need sir"
"Haaaaaaaa. Coach Gruden called me out. But I've got news for him: the truth of my game was considerably worse than the scouting report :-)"
"At some point, someone's going to have to tell <at>RealSkipBayless you can't MAKE the Texans take <at>JManziel2 -- not matter how hard he tries."
"Coach Gruden, don't listen to <at>RealSkipBayless about the Broncos in the AFC. It's them and NE. We know this. The SB is another matter."
"School <at>RealSkipBayless on Andrew Luck, Coach Gruden. School him. I've been telling skip this stuff for more than a year."
"I usually think <at>RealSkipBayless is lying through his teeth when he talks about enjoying life w/o me. But that last hour w/ Gruden,..TRUTH"
"Love ya back <at>RealSkipBayless, my brother . Now close strong"
"Come on <at>RealSkipBayless, you're always nervous about the Spurs ."
"I can't hear what Bruce Bowen is saying. His bow tie is making me deaf :-)"
"I struggled to hear Bruce with that outfit on and that bow tie, but his analysis is on point. Can't question the 3-time champion."
"He's talking too long though. Taking time away from my man <at>RealSkipBayless. Haaaa, who am I to talk, right!"
"Loving what I'm seeing from Deron Williams in this game. But not nearly as much as I'm loving listening my boy <at>RyanRuocco call it with PJ."
"I don't care what anyone says, it's totally wrong for the ref to call that. <at>RyanRuocco, tell PJ I Love'em, but give Vasquez a break there."
"Damnit! D-Will froze up at the free-throw <url>e on <url>e on. You better than that, as my man <at>RyanRuocco will gladly admit"
"A 3-pt play to DeRozan right now. Really? Really? How are the Raptors looking like the experienced bunch and the Nets are looking panicked!"
"The one good thing about being sick and stuck at home is that I haven't missed a minute of these last few games.   Wash/Chi is beautiful"
"If Wizards lose this game, look no further that NENE. To say it was ridiculously stupid of him to get ejected doesn't give stupidity justice"
"I love me some Damian Lillard y'all that's a baaaaaaaaddddd boy! He's putting on the show James Harden is suppose to be putting on"
"The <at>HoustonRockets have 12 minutes to decide do the want to make this a playoff series or do the want to get swept."
"Mo Williams is looking like he's back in Cleveland with LeBron. During the regular season, of course"
"But seriously, Mo Williams is BALLIN. I'm proud if this brother. And again, Lillard is at it. He'll deserve that $100 mil Adidas Deal"
"Jeremy Lin...what the hell were you thinking????? Why would you attempt that layup when you could've held the ball.#Brainlock"
"Where the hell was that foul for  <at>DwightHoward. He was mugged by Aldridge on that 1st play of OT"
"Now Jeremy Lin gets stripped. Turnover. Damn ! Damn! Damn!"
"Great hustle by Lin there. Then the pass to Daniels. Can Gundy may not know his name but we all know he can shoot."
"Everyone pump your damn breaks and calm down. Is it Monday yet? Damn! I'll respond to Mr. Donald Sterling's diatribe  when I return. #Wait"
"I just saw/heard the Sterling clip on TMZ 5 min ago. If it's real, all I'll say is this: My God I can't wait to get back to work on Monday."
"Y'all wanted me to talk Donald Sterling. You got me . Turn on SPORTSCENTER within next 8 min"
"Appreciate the love from you <at>KevinHart4real as always bro. Stay up. You know I will."

"For those of you who missed my radio show with <at>RyanRuocco, here ya go: <url>"
"Hell Yea I went off on the Brooklyn Nets'  fans. And I'm not about to apologize: <url>"
"Check out the film #WeCouldBeKing today on ABC at 4pm or ESPN2 at 9pm. Powerful story about Philly boys and how much #SPORTSMATTER"
"Actually I didn't, <at>SidCuddii. I look like a man who's too wired to get any damn sleep. I don't hang anymore. But I can't fall asleep."
"No hangover bro,<at>Mrhowudodatdere. I don't really drink. 2-drink max, and that's in the off season. Even lighter during the season"
"Good Lord have Mercy. What a game! What a game !"
"This is just embarrassing. The Clips are running them out the building and Westbrook can't help but turn the ball over. Brooks has to coach"
"OKC's answer can't evolve around 1-on-1 basketball. Space the floor. Set screens. Move the damn basketball."
"Apparently a bunch of folks are bothered by my take on Steve Kerr. Why? I have no idea: <url>"
"Here are my thoughts on Steve Kerr. Don't say I didn't tell you: <url>"
"For those who didn't see/ <url>prehend what I said on Steve Kerr, this should do the trick: <url>"
"I'm here in Miami. I cannot believe that there's 5 min left in this game and Deron Williams has zero points"
"I'm just tweeting to make sure my man <at>RealSkipBayless is okay. Can't believe Dallas passed on Manziel. This is getting bad. Manziel is Geno"
"What the hell are y'all talking about? I'm rested, feeling good. And I'm rocking the vest look instead of a suit this AM. I'm looking cool:)"
"Don't hate, <at>TheRealKColl. Emulate!:-)"
"<url>ing back on SPORTSCENTER in this hour and the 10am hour. Stick around"
"Haaaa"
"Puh-leeze <at>bvirvilos. Do I sound remotely concerned?"
"OMG. <at>RealSkipBayless is fired up. The Sterling's. Michael Sam. The Kiss. I can't predict how <at>ESPN_FirstTake is gonna be today.#BuckleUp"
"I stand by what I said in regards to Sam being picked in the 7th Round. That, however, has nothing to do with my feelings on other matters."
"Haaaaaa! Sorry bro.  Didn't know he was your guy"
"Why?"
"My man <at>RyanRuocco held it down for me the last couple of days. Now it's my turn. 1-3pm on ESPN Radio NY. Join me. 800.919.3776. #BuckleUp"
"Why did Kerr pick the Warriors? And where does that leave the #Knicks now? <url>"
"Bigtime game by the Spurs. <at>RealSkipBayless and I will discuss it, along with Sterling, NFL , eyc . Buckle up"
"Who says there's no way <at>KingJames will go back to Cleveland? If ya didn't hear my radio show w/ <at>RyanRuocco today: <url>"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, this could very well be the new opening of my radio show w/ <at>RyanRuocco: <url> Thoughts?????"
"About to touch on Mark <url>ments even more. LISTEN folks. Pay attention. Don't let emotions rule. Listen to the facts!"
"I'm on SPORTSCENTER at the top of the hour. Nobody's running. I've already discussed it on <at>ESPN_FirstTake about <url>ments. #More2say"
"Stop the damn B.S., LIFEMANAGEMINT . You know exactly what I was talking about. Don't try to change the issue. It's about US. What we do!"
"For those who have something to say to me about <url>ments, no one's hiding. Me and <at>RyanRuocco are here, ESPN Radio NY. (98.7 FM)."
"Bring it"
"800.919.3776. Or tweet me right here."
"I said what I said re: <url>ments and I meant what I meant. <at>mcuban said nothing wrong. He was just honest. Don't run. Deal with it."
"These were my thoughts today on <at>mcuban: <url>"
"Here is the podcast of my radio show today with <at>RyanRuocco....regarding <at>mcuban and more: <url>"
"You're wrong, <at>Chris_Broussard. But it's cool."
"I'm continuing the convo I had with Dr. Dyson on <at>ESPN_FirstTake today on ESPN Radio NY (98.7FM) with my boy <at>RyanRuocco. Call:800.919.3776"
"Can't respond to everyone. Just wanted to say thanks to those who agreed with me today on <at>ESPN_FirstTake, and even to those who disagree."
"The convo with me and Dr. Dyson was necessary and long overdue. No matter your belief, so long as it's thoughtful, we all learn from this."
"About to be on Anderson Cooper right now, except not with AC. The one-and-only Wolf Blitzer is filling in. Check out CNN right now."
"The rest of y'all may be off for Memorial Day, but not the boys. <at>ESPN_FirstTake  is in the <url>ing at ya right now. Holla."
"Folks, my apologies. I did not know <at>ESPN_FirstTake was on ESPNews this morning. NOT ESPN2!!!!"
"The fact that you would say I said that shows 1 of 2 things about you , AWills07 <at>RayRice27. You <url>prehend English or it a liar. !"
"Watching this game, the Spurs could be in huge trouble if they don't figure out how to deal <url>bo of Ibaka and Adams"
"Good Lawd. That stroke from <at>KDTrey5  is too sweet for words. And Tony Parker looks as if he's scared to make a play vs <at>russwest44. Damn!"
"Wow! What an explosion. OKC has 20 assists and only 6 TO's. And <at>russwest44 is playing lights out. We ourselves a Western Conference Finals."
"It's 8 minutes left in the 3rd QT and Indiana has just 37 points. How much more pathetic can you be!"
"What a Bigtime performance by Paul George. Sensational. What we've been waiting for all-season-long."
"Stupid play by Hill. All he had to do was hold the damn ball. Attempting a contested layup at that point serves no purpose"
"Tried to tell my man <at>RealSkipBayless what was gonna happen tonight. He wouldn't listen."
"I'm sorry it I'm just totally ashamed of the Indiana Pacers tonight. I knew they were going down; never imagined they'd go out like this."
"Haaaaaaaaa! That tweet was hilarious <at>MikeWiseguy"
"FYI.....First Take is on ESPNews until tennis is over. Then we switch back to ESPN2."
"We're back on ESPN2 right now. Finals' prediction on the way"
"Who the hell said that <at>Newton_Heels. No one call <at>mcuban that. I just said he needs to be careful. Stop the damn lying"
"About <url>e on SPORTSCENTER right now. Ofcourse <at>ESPN_FirstTake is on the way at the top of the hour"
"You've got to be kidding me. Hear done in by the damn AC system. Now I've seen it all"
"I'm back in the house. And I harbor no responsibility for what <at>RealSkipBayless will say about <at>KingJames with his hatin' self. Buckle up!"
"Chillin in San Antonio, but just wanted to take a moment to send out a prayer for <at>RealTracyMorgan following accident this AM. #GodBless."
"Whoa! Cotto 3 knockdowns in the 1st Round. Martinez badly hurt. Cotto left hook."
"Hey, Cotto looks superb. His defense. Power. Left hook. I don't have Cotto losing 1-single round yet thru the first 8. #MayweatherCotto2"
"Make that 9-0 thru nine rounds. And I don't want to hear anything about Martinez' knee. He's getting annihilated."
"Martinez trainer throws in the towel. It's over. Cotto by TKO."
"A quick break in the action? Here's something for y'all from <at>RealSkipBayless and myself."
"Yes. Unfortunately,  I know you won't :-)"
"Yes! I do have. <url>mercial. This time: Beats By Dre. Check it out: <url>"
"Haaa! Haaaa! Check out the <at>ESPN_FirstTake remix for the top of the show today in Miami: <url>"
"I'm totally shocked by how Miami just didn't show up to play tonight. Leonard outplayed everyone, but Mia also got NOTHING from Chalmers."
"Heard all the noise over my saying <at>carmeloanthony & <at>KingJames could pair-up someday. Enough! Read and learn: <url>"
"For those who don't know, <at>ESPN_FirstTake is only on for an hour today, and it's on ESPNews -- not ESPN2"
"Mia looks terrible on offense. Not moving the ball. Forcing passes when they do. On D, doubling unnecessarily. Just out of sync"
"I am stunned at the way the Heat are looking right now. They keep this up, it's over by Sunday. Hey! At least I'd be home by Monday."
"Ladies/Gentlemen, what we are witnessing is a good ole fashion ass whipping (excuse my language). D-Wade has no legs. LBJ looks exhausted"
"I'll admit it right now: I dropped the ball. Mia looks totally gassed. Out of shape. The Spurs are accustomed to running out West. It shows."
"Yes I do.  And I don't care"
"The Love Dr has been requested again. He's up next on ESPN NY (98.7FM). <at>Oprah or <at>OWNTV may not show enough love to is men, but I'm here :)"
"This flight from Miami on <at>AmericanAir is just disgraceful. Sitting on the plane for 2 hours. Paperwork hasn't arrived! Just damn ridiculous"
"No, I am not on my way yet <at>AmericanAir. I'm told we'll leave shortly........for the 10th time now"
"Whew! If y'all are not watching this Djokovic/Federer match, turn the damn channel. Get in front if a TV. It's special right now."
"Match is back and forth but Federer looks potent when charging the Net. But this IS Djokovic he's going against here, who's winning, btw."
"Djokovic has broken Federer's serve 3 straight times."
"Don't y'all dear start asking me questions about <at>KingJames & <at>carmeloanthony. Me and <at>RealSkipBayless r back tomorrow on <at>ESPN_FirstTake"
"We're rested and ready to roar. Buckle up, <url>es <at>ESPN_FirstTake. See y'all tomorrow morning"
"What <url>eback by Federer. 1 minute he looks old and worn, next minute he's roaring back from 3-down. Unbelievable, win, lose , or draw."
"My plan was to wait for <at>ESPN_FirstTake in the AM. But <at>SportsCenter has called me for duty. Here <url>e. Approx 11:30pm. Buckle Up!"
"Or probably on a few minutes earlier."
"On in 5 minutes, gents. <at>SportsCenter. Check it out."
"Less than 20 min away from SHOWTIME. <at>ESPN_FirstTake is baaaaaccckkkk! ESPN2 at 10am. Holla!"
"I'm sorry folks. I hate having to go off on Josh Gordon like that. But the brother is special/Bigtime. It sickens me to see him do this."
"Neither myself nor anyone can help him by giving him a pass. I want him to have a great career but he's got to clean up his damn act."
"Just 20 min away from hitting the radio waves with my man <at>RyanRuocco on ESPN Radio (98.7FM) in NYC. Call-in# 800.919.3776. Holla!"
"Get the hell up and get ready. Your boy is back in the house on ESPN Radio (98.7 FM) in NY.  800.919.3776. #HollaAtYourBoyyyyyyyyss"
"For those who missed me talking about NBA free agency on ESPN Radio today, here ya go: <url>"
"<at>1truseatlefan Turn the damn channel then. Nobody asked your $&<at> to watch. Bye!"
"Nothing in the world can ruin my day today. My man <at>MauriceBenardMB from General Hospital came on <at>ESPN_FirstTake today. I'm in HEAVEN.  Haa"
"I am at the ESPY's y'all. And I don't care what anyone says: Drake is freaking hilarious. Skits with Blake Griffin/ Imitating Pacquaio#Haaa"
"Can't believe all this nonsense about Tony Dungy. Check out. <at>ESPN_FirstTake right now"
"I'm gonna repeat right here what I just said on <at>ESPN_FirstTake: I do NOT have a problem with what Tony Dungy said. For a couple of reasons:"
"A.) Dungy's quote stated the obvious. Some folks wouldn't touch Sam because they, essentially, know their locker room and could do w/o it."
"B.) from a religious perspective, he's been consistent on his views. Period."
"Again, I've always been an adversary of Gay Prejudice. No room in our society for it. But that doesn't mean someone can't express Dungy's"
"Sentiments. It's life. We've got to deal with it. We'll continue to learn and grow"
"Uh oh! <at>RealSkipBayless in a different kind of mood today. Must be <at>KingJames or <at>JManziel2. I'll try to keep him calm on <at>ESPN_FirstTake"
"Just to re-cap my thoughts for today: I'd NEVER forgive Conseco if I were McGwire. And <at>KingJames is right to get his $$$ when teams are"
"in the NBA are being sold for $2-Billion. If owners can get their money, why are players always being asked to take a pay cut."
"So let me get this straight <at>theRealRudyLara. The Brothers should be happy with what they're getting? Even if they're worth more? #Hmmmm"
"Don't forget why players will look bad <at>razzell2. It's because the public has been convinced they're bad b/c they should be THANKFUL.#Sad"
"I'm totally ticked off, <at>kicklace. they'd better hope good and damn well I don't talk about this."
"My series of tweets a short time ago is not an adequate way to capture my thoughts so I am using a single (cont) <url>"
"You've been waiting to hear from me. Now you will in approx 30 minutes. <url>ing at ya at 10am. No one's hiding!"
"My apology on <at>ESPN_FirstTake Monday morning speaks for itself. I accept ESPN's Decision. See you all next Wednesday. God Bless!"
"Yes! It's true. I will be back on <at>ESPN_FirstTake tomorrow, as will my man <at>RealSkipBayless. See y'all then."

"What the hell are you talking about, <at>BrackinBangBang <at>RealSkipBayless <at>espn? Everyone <url>ments, then <url>e at us with your nonsense"
"Answer me this one question, <at>wideopeninc. Do you want someone else hurt? Think big picture for a damn change."
"Y'all better go someplace with y'all nonsense. Brown was shot. The officer needs to be pay. But I agree with POTUS. All sides needed 2 chill"
"Y'all don't like that position. Too damn bad."
"That tweet of yours is ignorant, <at>iHateJoeBlax. And you know it. What the hell are you looking for? More twitter followers? Pathetic!"
"Just because someone is asking you not to look or vandalize, <at>24Librascales, doesn't mean you're being asked not to do anything."
"Folks are ridiculous, <at>kingjc1987. I echo POTUS and I'm an Uncle Tom. Why? B/c I don't want US further harming ourselves. I'm done, man!"
"I'm going to leave it like this: my show on SiriusXM MadDog radio debuts Sept.2nd. I'll have MORE time to get into stuff like"

"Off from <at>ESPN_FirstTake until Monday folks. Hitting the ground running when my new radio show begins on MadDog SiriusXM on Tuesday <at> 1pm"
"Oh my damn, impressive drive run by Kenny Hill. Good poise. Nice arm. Good poise. Nice job so far. Texas A & M on the board."
"Perfect throw on 2nd down by Thompson. That pass has to be caught. Btw.....it's just the first QT, but the Aggies D already looks better."
"Kenny Hill has got athleticism, too. He can evade pressure and run with the football. Plain and simple."
"The new Stephen A. Smith Show on SiriusXM MadDog Radio debuts tomorrow at 1pm (Channel 85). Just reaching out to thank you all 4 ur support."

"Damn. Rodgers had the first down and threw it away. Plus, I really have a problem with not one pass being thrown <at>RSherman_25 way. #Damn!"

"<at>mikellie2 I don't have to WISH anything. Been getting paid to do it for 2 decades. While you follow my every move. Get a damn life."
"Big stops by GB at end of half, then start of second half. Seattle could've had the game rapped up by now if GB's D had folded. They didn't"
"So much for that notion. A-Rod was at fault there. Bad pass to Jordy Nelson"

"I know Foles can't only do but so much with backups protecting him on the OL, but <url>e on!"
"WTH. I leave for a second and what do I return to: actual games taking place in Philly, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Baltimore, afterall. Yes!"

"Let's be clear: I specifically said Goodell should not have to resign ABSENT any evidence that he saw the rice' tape months earier. #UhOh!"

"Okay, Floyd looks to be employing the rope a dope. Jabs to the body to set up the right. Maidana wins round though. Getting very interesting"
"Floyd moving. Hitting with jabs, counter punches and straight shots. Maidana answering with double l-hooks. Floyd wins round but is tired!"
"He can't breath after taking that shot to the nose is Round 4"

"Whoa! Fight stalled with 19sec left in Round 8....Maidana BITES Floyd. Round goes to Zfloyd"
"Floyd wins Round 9, but basically by default. Both are missing. Floyd looks slower and heavier than usual. But did connect a couple times"
"Maidana docked pt for throwing Floyd to canvas. He's swinging wildly but missing mostly. Floyd is just too elusive for this dude."
"Floyd wins Round 11. Same ole same ole"
"I had Maidana winning 1 round, which was Round 4....aside from being given Round 12 because Floyd simply stayed away."
"I applaud Floyd for acknowledging he deserved a C-minus grade for his performance. He didn't have it. He was slow. He could be better. And.."
"He will be for Manny Pacquaio . Book it. <url>ing. Mark my words."
"Floyd needs to stop showing everyone his hand. We know he got bite, but it wasn't his ear. Plus, his nose and lip got busted. #ugh"

"Yours truly throughout the afternoon right here. The NBA Playoffs are here baby. Let's get this party started."
"My thing is: I'm so disappointed with how the Wizards ended this season. They have the talent. They should beat Toronto. But why believe?"
"Vasquez cannot guard John Wall. Wall should have a field day."
"Good 3 by Pierce. He needs to show up in this series with all the talking he's done. But I believe he will. Let's see what Wall and Beal do!"
"Wall and Pierce. Toronto will need to find a way to hold one of them in check in order to win this series"
"Pierce is BALLIN. He's saying to Toronto: ""Yall Don't Know!"" Or last years mantra: ""That's Why They Brought Me Here."""
"Keep in mind, I picked Toronto to win this series, but here's a huge problem it has: Wall can hold Lowry in check. That's a huge problem."
"Paul Pierce is putting on a show. Meanwhile, Toronto has not adjusted to Wizards smaller lineup and they are not hitting perimeter shots."
"Raptors starting to penetrate into teeth of Wizards D. Here <url>e. But Beal also needs to play better. If he does, Wizards grab Game 1"
"It's the 4th QT and the Raptors, one of the top offenses in the game, doesn't even have 60 pts. Is this about their offense or Wizards' D?"
"Uh-Oh. 13-2 run"
"Crucial call vs. Amir Johnson. Bogus call at tis point, negating Lou Willis' 3. Could cost Toronto the game"
"Wizards can't play as well as they've played then lose this game. A loss will be devastating"
"Great move by Beal. Got Lowry out the game. Toronto's in trouble. Not that they weren't already of course. Not a good game for Lowry"
"What a Game. Wizards almost blew it. Looking good right now, though"
"A loss is a loss. But no way in Hell should Toronto go scoreless in OT."

"Unselfish play by the Warriors. Ain't scared to shar/move the ball because the knows cats are gonna do something with it. Just lethal!"
"Right when I was on the verge of applauding New Orleans for hanging in there, the splash brothers explode. Just like that. BANG!"

"Job he did with Peyton Manning....who established his greatness 15 yrs b4 Gase ever stepped onto the scene? Really? I tell you, man......."

"I mean, why is Hoyer still on the sidelines? Why doesn't he just leave the stadium right now, go home, pack and leave town for good!"
"Is it too much to ask for the Steelers to just throw the damn ball away? Big Ben gets hurt b/c he didn't do it and Landry just takes a sack!"

"Like it's alright that he missed the damn FG. He's actually worse that Hoyer right now. The kicker should run straight to the parking lot,"

"Alright Skip! Calm down. That was a damn good pass by Watson. I'll admit it. But we'll see!"
"Jesus! This is Vince Young all over again.Watson is in rhythm. Clemson is in hurry-up. They're not subbing so Bama can't sub. #Trouble"
"A second strike from Watson to a damn Freshman Walk-On in Renfrow. You have got to be kidding me!"
"Ok, Clemson has proven to be too dangerous. Bama has to pound them down. Ridley has to get loose to give them play/action.#ChampionshipTake"
"Good Lord, Watson is just special man. He's scaring me to death. He's an escape artist.#ChampionshipTake"
"I know Coker can play but I'm not the biggest fan. His pocket awareness is highly questionable. Always seems surprised.#ChampionshipTake"
"Okay! Now it's time for Bama to pull away. B/c if they don't and Watson has the ball at the end w/ a chance to win...OMG.#championshiptake"
"Dammit, Coker. Throw it away. Run the damn football. Do anything but hold the ball.#championshiptake"
"Btw folks, I'm not happy about Burfict getting suspended. Never happy to see any man losing money. W/ that said, though, he deserved it"
"Just enjoying a great championship game <at>BandLDaddy. That's all"

"Ok. Maybe not :-).#championshiptake"
"Bama can't stop Watson. They can only hope to contain him. #championshiptake"
"Terrible pass by Coker. The boy felt pressure that was barely even there. Damn! Damn! Damn!#championshiptake"
"Great pass from Coker....a 38-target to Stewart. Finally......a 3rd down converted. About damn time.#championshiptake"
"Yeah! Easy throw for Coker to O.J. Howard. Blown coverage. Clemson trails in 4th QT for 1st time all season. Now what? #championshiptake"
"Wwwwhhhheeewwwwww!!!!!! What a big time return by Drake. Big time! But there's still plenty of time. Watson's a beast.#championshiptake"
"See what I'm saying. Clemson TD. At least they stopped the 2-point conversion, though. Now Bama MUST not give ball back.#championshiptake"
"I agree with Herbstreit about McKenzie Alexander. That play to Howard wouldn't have happened if he were in the game.#championshiptake"
"You have got to be kidding me. Another timeout used? Good Lord.#ChampionshipTake"
"Bootleg for the first down. Okay Coker, I see you. First down......AL-A-BAM-A.#championshiptake."
"After that ""confirmed"" TD, there's only one thing left to say: Roollllllllllllllllllll TIDE!.#ChampionshipTake"
"Congrats to <at>ClemsonFB. Dabo did a fantastic job this year. And Watson is simply special. Great Nat'l Title Game. #ChampionshipTake"

"No! No! No! If you are <at>KDTrey5 you cannot turn that ball over. A <at>StephenCurry30 3 and now the score is tied. We about to find out......."
"I cannot believe how <at>KDTrey5 is playing right now. And that last turnover by Westbrook didn't help either. Nerves OKC's Kryptonite now."
"One turnover after another. By Durant. By Westbrook. It's just one game but totally hurts me to say this: Straight CHOKE JOB in last minutes"
"<at>GlockRivers my apologies. I meant second best"
"Yeah! <at>FirstTake in the house right now. Let's Go Y'all"
"The <at>cavs can beat anybody IF they bring their A game. <url>"
"My Game 7 pick...<url>"
"I'm questioning Kerr's decision to start Iguodala instead of Barnes. Seems to have created a spacing issue right now. May not be a big deal."
"Loving ball movement by OKC. But it's early"
"Waiters not making shots, but driving to the basket strong, feeding other guys. Warriors look very unimpressive so far. Hmmmmm!!!"
"Warriors look incredibly tight offensively. Can't hit anything. OKC very loose. This is getting very interesting."
"Bottom line: <at>StephenCurry30 and <at>KlayThompson are gonna have <url>e through. No one else is confident shooting the ball."
"Meanwhile, OKC is loose, looking like they're playing with House Money. Moving the ball. Relying on others. Exactly what they didn't do GM 6"
"Bye.....<at>KDTrey5 played a great first half. Only took 5 shots. Made 4 of them. Efficient. Thorough. And OKC is winning because of it."
"Right now, it's not about what OKC is NOT doing. It's about what <at>StephenCurry30 IS doing. This brother is just on another level"
"All OKC is doing is running isolations....and Donovan is letting them. No ball movement. And <at>KDTrey5 is not making shots.#GoodLord!"
"Big time shot by <at>KDTrey5 . He's got A little time left. It ain't over folks"
"It ain't over folks. <at>KDTrey5 <url>ing. Let's see what <at>warriors do now. They've got to make a shot -- then a stop -- to seal this."
"Draymond shaky with the ball on last two occasions. Doesn't need to touch it now. <at>warriors need to play 2-man ball."
"Bogus call vs Ibaka right there. You don't make that call in this situation, giving Steph 3 pts. Very weak"
"I can't believe what I just saw: <at>KDTrey5 misses trey, <at>warriors rebound then <at>okcthunder just stopped playing, giving <at>StephenCurry30 trey"
"Gm 6 will live w/Kevin Durant for the rest of his career until he wins a championship. <url>"
"Steph Curry showed up and was a man amongst boys. <url>"
"The NBA Finals are here. Why did the <at>warriors win; the <at>okcthunder lose. And <url>ing next. <at>FirstTake at the top of he hour.#AAAHHHH!"
"Not true, <at>LAlfarone. I personally saw <at>russwest44 walk up to the Warriors and shake their hands before leaving. It was just before buzzer"
"Right now <at>StephenCurry30 looks like the best closer since MJ but there's still work to be done. <url>"
"If <at>KDTrey5 & <at>russwest44 are going to stay together the <at>okcthunder need to get a true PG. <url>"
"You're absolutely right, <at>justleon. The dude is big time. But IF you don't show up when it COUNTS,what are we suppose to say bro?"
"Kevin Durant is the modern day <at>KingJames. <url>"
"Steph Curry has given us reason to believe <at>KingJames is no longer the best player in the world. <url>"
"I don't give a damn what <at>RealSkipBayless says: you <url>pare 6-for-6 in the Finals to 2-&-4. If taken was issue, we'd still talk Penny"
"Typo. I meant if ""Talent"" was issue......we'd still be talking about Penny Hardaway"
"The biggest reason Rex Ryan should be on the hot seat..<url>"
"What a Damn Shame. More than 60 deaths in Chicago this week and practically leading every news outlet is the story about the gorilla. I'm so"
"thankful that little kid ended up safe -- Thank God -- but, again, it's a Damn Shame that <at>oreillyfactor has to bring on 2 African-Americans"
"From Chicago to address this story before the appropriate attention is brought to it. A Dem as Mayor; A Republican as Governor = Nothing!"
"What the Hell is up??? Both guests suggested the Nat'l Guard be brought in. I can't begin to say I know the answer but can we do something?"
"This is just ridiculous! Sad! Trifling! Something has to be done. They're calling it a War Zone. Who can say they're wrong. #ActionRequired!"
"I respectfully disagree w/ <at>CoachJim4UM and here's why... <url>"
"I don't blame <at>KingJames for feeling the way he feels. <url>"
"It absolutely broke my heart to do this - b/c I want <at>KingJames to win badly, but I had to pick <at>warriors in 7. Can pick Love over Draymond!"
"Hey <at>GeorgeAtallah and Mr. Glorious -- I see you want my attention. Well, you have it. The Stephen A. Smith Show on SiriusXM <at>MadDogRadio"
"You'll be hearing from me soon enough."
"Guess who's going to be on ""The Chew"" tomorrow. Told y'all don't sleep on my cooking skills.#Haaaaaaa!!!! <url>"
"If <at>kobebryant in his prime was on this <at>cavs team instead of <at>KingJames it's no way the <at>warriors would be favored. <url>"
"This is some DISGRACEFUL nonsense. <url>"
"We need to take off the rose-colored glasses when <url>es to <at>StephenCurry30. <url>"
"Draymond misses 1st open trey. Love makes his."
"The 1st Qt hasn't even ended yet and the Cavs are sucking air. Lue may have played starters too many minutes."
"Don't know what Kerr was thinking with playing that lineup at end of quarter, though. Either way, GS must figured how to keep LBJ from paint"
"Bar boss is lighting them up. Now Cavs have to put in their defensive unit. Exactly what I feared. How will they keep up???"
"GSW up 39-29. Klay hasn't scored yet and Curry hasn't played the 2nd Qt. damn!"
"JR Smith has attempted just one shot. What the Hell!!!"
"Love and LBJ showed up. JR? 0-for-1 in 18 min.#Jesus"
"Kyrie and <url>bine to shoot 1-for-11 shooting in 2nd Quarter."
"I sense a 2nd Hslf explosion from Steph & Klay. Just on the court, looking into their eyes, they seem totally annoyed."
"Amazing how easily the tempo changes. Curry and Klay can't seem to do anything right. <url>es Cleveland"
"Damn! It shouldn't take this long for refs to make a decision. It's a rhythm-killer.  No punches were thrown so what's the problem"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, his name is Shaun Livingston"
"Hey Y'all. Can anyone tell me how I did on ""The Chew"" today on ABC? I didn't see it."

"My 1st memory of Ali. #RIPMuhammadAli <url>"
"Who shot JR? #NBAFinals <url>"
"Back to back 3's by Steph and Klay out of a timeout. And we're getting FT's from LBJ. Unacceptable. He needs to do more. Teammates need him."
"Learned something tonight: did y'all know Cle' most effective lineup in ECF was: LBJ, Shumpert, Fry, Dellevadova & Jefferson? Just saying!"
"Cleveland is lucky GSW looks this damn sloppy."
"If Draymond keeps this up he'll be NBA Finals MVP."
"This is bad and getting worse. Love might have a concussion. LBJ is playing like he does. GSW has converted on like 10 back door cuts. And.."
"Clevelands only answer is a drive by LBJ or a jumper by Kyrie -- both 1-on-1 plays. A blowout is in full effect. This MAY end in 5, OR 4"
"About damn time Mozgov is in the game. Try something Lue. Anything. Damn!"
"This is downright embarrassing. The Cavs should be ashamed of themselves. Totally overmatched now, but especially with EFFORT. #Disgraceful!"
"Please! Please! Please! Don't miss me Postgame, ppl. I'm telling y'all right now that I'm going ballistic. I don't give a damn.#disgraceful"
"Kerr needs to get Curry out of the game. No purpose whatsoever for him to be in the game"

"I can't defend this anymore. <url>es a pt where you tell your team: ""Move the $&<at>$ out of my way. I'll win it my damn self."" Regardless!"
"Cleveland shot 14 more free throws and <url>mitted 20 turnovers, and <at>cavs still lost by 30"
"The <at>cavs put up one of the most pathetic scenes in all my years of watching the #NBAFinals. <url>"

"Aqib Talib needs to act like a grown man. <url>"

"In what world is Tony Romo a proven winner? <url>"
"You don't need <at>KDTrey5 if you're the <at>warriors. It would be weak for them to grab him. <url>"
"Uh Oh! Kyrie on fire"
"Something to pay attention to: If that's a contusion by Klay Thompson, he's gonna be hurting the rest of this series. Could spell trouble."
"So let me get this straight: Curry & Klay go scoreless in 1st, Curry has 2pts at half, the Cavs led by 30 and now it's only an 8-pt Half???"
"Question everyone: if LBJ was the MVP and a champion, but had 2-pts in the 1st Half, what would we say about him? Just asking!"
"I cannot believe how awful <at>StephenCurry30 looks tonight. Worse game I've seen him play -- EVER. And Klay isn't much better tonight."
"Now <at>KingJames has the jumper flowing. Okay! Okay."

"That was one wonderful tribute give to Muhammad Ali by Billy Crystal"
"I hope I'm wrong but I think the <at>warriors are going to win tonight. <url>"
"Kevin Love enters to huge standing ovation. Responds with good defense on Barnes, then off. Rebound and put back. Let's see what happens"
"Love, posting and pushing Iguodala. Exactly what he's suppose to do!"
"Tristan Thompson is going to be a problem for GSW. They can't keep him off the boards"
"I don't know what's up with LBJ tonight. He's into it. Energized. But just 3pts? Damn!"
"Right now, Steph, Klay, Kyrie all playing like they're suppose to. The ONLY person not playing the way he's suppose to is <at>KingJames.#Damn!"
"At this point there's only one conclusion to draw: it's on Kyrie now. He's the off. Player on Cleveland you can trust"
"OMG. That jumper by LEBRON was so bad, only one thing you can conclude: he looks nervous."
"Iguodala, Draymond and the crew are active. Blocking shots. Getting every loose ball. Every rebound."
"Cleveland fans have been leaving for last several minutes. Rare have I ever seen a fan base look so dejected. 1954 and counting"
"I am DONE with the NBA on this. Draymond Green suspended? Hiding behind a Flagrant 1. This is some straight BS. Absolute TRAVESTY!"
"Draymond Green's suspension was bogus. <url>"
"Go 'Head! Go 'Head and miss <at>FirstTake this morning if you want to. All I'll say is this: I'm ticked off. & Skip wants to talk LBJ. #Uh Oh!"
"Draymond Green did not deserve to be suspended. <url>"
"O.J. Simpson was guilty & he only leaned on the <url>munity for support as he stood trial for a double murder. <url>"
"Kevin Love needs to wake up and understand why he gets a bad rap sometimes. <url>"
"The violence has to stop! #Orlando <url>"
"Do y'all see this? Do y'all see how <at>cavs came out? Flat! Panicky! TO by LBJ on first touch. Ridiculous already."
"Okay LBJ! A 3. Okay"
"Okay. GSW already in the penalty and LBJ is hitting his jumper. This may get interesting after all"
"Klay and Kyrie are putting on a show. Btw....<at>KingJames isn't too shabby either. He's got 16"
"On <at>FirstTake today I told y'all two things: A.) That <at>KingJames will explode. And B.) That <at>warriors may still find a way"
"All this noise about Iguodala being able to guard LEBRON can be out to rest. Only criticism abt <at>KingJames: Why Doesn't he do this ALWAYS!"
"OMG that's an ugly looking knee injury from Bogut. He's done, from the looks of it. Can't seem <url>ing back from this"
"Everyone was waiting to see what LBJ does in the 4th Qt. Doesn't matter. LEBRON has Kyrie -- who abuses Steph 1-on-1 every time. #OhWell!"

"Steph Curry just needs to show up tonight. <url>"
"LeBron needs <url>e with the same mentality he had in Game 5. <url>"
"Now THIS is how the Finals are suppose to be: <at>StephenCurry30 AND <at>KingJames ballin! This is what we've waited for. <url>e down to wire!"
"Oooooohhhhh! Did y'all just see <at>KingJames block <at>StephenCurry30 shot, then talk smack? Twice? It's getting extra up in here. Game 7. ON!!!"
"This is what it's all about: LBJ talking Smack to Steph. This is what you want a Game 7 for!#CantWaitUntilSunday! <url>"
"That would be me bro..<at>WaydeDay <at>Cloudten22. I'm a man. I'll admit I was wrong. Down 3-1. The way <at>Cavs looked? I thought it was. Game 7!"
"What the hell is wrong w/ some of y'all? To hell with refs, no-calls ally his crap. You have a Game 7 with Steph and LBJ. WTH is up w/ y'all"
"My Game 7 pick: <url>"
"I asked for the Oakland & Cleveland police departments to put out an APB for <at>hbarnes. <url>"
"So far, Steph is messin up. Playing around with the ball, whining after missed shots and not getting back on D. Only two things worse 4 now:"
"A.) LEBRON hasn't looked for his shot enough, + has turned the ball over 3 times. B.) Harrison Barnes is a no-show again. Just sit him down!"
"All I know is....<at>Money23Green has been SPECTACULAR in this first half. So much so, they need to look to get him open just as much as Steph!"

"I don't think he'll end up going anywhere. But I will say this: <at>KingJames is in the driver's seat. He has fulfilled his promise. He doesn't"

"I know it's just a preseason game, but the <at>Giants had better pray nothing ever happens to ELI. Nassib didn't look good, nor anyone else."
"Nice throw from <at>CJ12_ to this kid Powell for Buffalo. I'm rooting for Cardale, although he came out and threw an INT on very next pass."
"Obviously, he's got his work cut out for him, and playing for Rex doesn't necessarily help any offensive player. We'll see."
"Just finished giving a speech in Kansas City. Now I'm watching the <at>Chiefs vs. <at>RamsNFL. They'll take AFC West unless <at>Broncos find a QB"

"To recap, I'm very proud and happy for Team-USA and especially <at>carmeloanthony. But I'm a native NYer. Starving for a title.#PriorityinOct."
"And yes, I'm real worried that this season is going to be boring. That GS is going to dominate during regular season. What's wrong w/ that?"

"Bryce Harper now, huh. Y'all need to stop this nonsense already. I <url>e on! I like <at>TimTebow, but this is ridiculous."
"You've got to be kidding me. I like <at>TimTebow. I really do. But he has no business getting a tryout in MLB. Just said so on <at>FirstTake."

"Two catches by Bonner III to set up FG to end half. HOUSTON up 19-17 at the half. Whatcha gonna do Sooners? Whatcha gonna do"
"Another TD by Houston. Now a fumble by OK! Mayfield is running for his life & making plays. It's not his fault. But Sooners not looking good"
"Anything can happen but I don't want to hear a damn word about the Sooners right now. Houston is giving it to them, waxing their butts."
"Mayfield fumbles...loses it. Houston ball.#GoodLordHaveMercy"
"Leonard Fournette.....Here we go. Let's see what LSU has???"
"Terrible, terrible pass by Bart Houston. Lack of experience. Couldn't handle the pressure. Sigh of relief for LSU."
"Hey LSU: Get the damn ball to Leonard Fournette. 11 rushes for 35 yards? Les Miles, what are you doing???"
"Man, if Les Miles don't keep giving the ball to Fournette LSU will lost this game. It's 7 min left in 3rd and LSU doesn't have a point."
"Maurice Smith for Georgia. Good cover speed, breaking up play. But this UNC WB looks impressive so far. Gotta keep watching this"
"This damn Chip Kelly. How in the hell is Kaepernick a backup to Blsine Gabbert. I can't wait for <at>FirstTake on Monday. I just can't wait."

"Whoa! Beautiful TD pass from Wentz to Jordan Matthews....outside shoulder, away from defender. Very impressive."
"On to Jets Game: Brandon Marshall too big for Pacman. Watch that matchup. Forte just had a nice 14-yard run, & nice gain off swing pass. Hmm"
"Terrell Pryor ""Starting"" at WR for Browns. See <at>TimTebow. You can shift from QB to something else to help an NFL team. No need to run to MLB"
"Btw....dropped pass, nothing on ground, then a scramble by RG3. In other words, nothing on his first drive as a <at>Browns"
"Horrible looking play by <at>Browns on 4th & 5. Plus, only two inc for RG3 were on dropped passes. Just what I suspected: no help for RG3."
"Why, <at>friendzone_gawd? <at>TimTebow could be a damn good TE! He belongs in the NFL"
"Another dropped pass by one of RG3's receivers. Corey Coleman this time. RG3 is looking fine. Again, he just needs help."
"Yo, Y'all.....check out this catch by Terrell Pryor. BIGTIME! I'm starting to imagine what things could be like once RG3 has him & Gordon."
"On another note the <at>Chargers are making me eat crow. Defense is all over Alex Smith. <at>Chiefs can't get anything going. Dominated so far!"
"Man, the <at>Chiefs look like hell <at>DeeNeal62. They don't seem to know what they're doing. They look confused"
"Not a good day this far for Jets' Kicker Nick Folk. Missed FG, then missed X-Pt. Hets up 13-10"
"Two nice TD passes: Brees to Cook and Osweiler to Hopkins. Good to see"

"BTW.....major props to <at>DeAndreHopkins. After all this noise, he showed up and BALLED. Did his JOB. That’s what I wanted to see.#Respect"
"Great drive by <at>Seahawks. If <at>HoustonTexans lose, this in on O’Brien or the O-coordinator. Keep the ball in Watson’s hands & likely win."
"BTW......it’s amazing how <at>HoustonTexans did is practically non-existent without J.J. Watt in lineup. Totally different defense"
"Major props to <at>HoustonTexans though. Fought valiantly. And I like O’Brien but man, you’ve got to take chances. Watson is special. Roll Dice"
"Yeeaaaahhhhh!!! <at>steelers defense holds — in Red Zone again. Now all Big Ben has to do is get 1st Down. Give it to me fellas! Bring it home"
"Why the hell are the <at>steelers throwing the football right then on 2nd down and stopping the clock? I swear I wonder about Haley sometimes."
"I’m done. This WS is just ridiculous. Insane. After Springer makes an EGO mistake instead of staying in front of the ball, losing the lead,"
"Springer turns around and shows massive heart with a solo blast at the bottom of the inning with a 480-Ft homer. Lord have mercy.#Crazy"
"I don’t mind saying this to anyone: Watching Altuve throughout these playoffs, I haven’t felt this excited since watching Barry Bonds!"
"And now Correa. This is unreal. I know Marrow should’ve been taken out. He needs a day. But w/ <at>astros, would it really make a difference?"

"Are you kidding me? Now Puig hits a HR with one hand. 2-run shot. It’s now 12-11. I can’t! I just can’t!"
"Tie Game. Taylor single up middle. Guess that means HOUSTON wins at bottom of inning because <at>Dodgers have no pitching left. They’re spent!"
"Even if Jansen stops them in 9th, there’s the 10th, considering the way this game has gone"
"Every time Altuve swings hard at first pitch and misses, he usually ends up smacking home run. I have that feeling now"
"Whew!"
"Bad loss for <at>Dodgers. All they seem to have is Jansen and the <at>astros don’t fear him. Now, Verlander is 9 innings away from title. Not good"

"Thank you <at>MikeAndMike. <url>"
"Whoa! <at>sixers dropped 47 on the <at>warriors in the first QT. Covington hitting 3’s from everyone. But it IS only the 1st QT. Still exciting to watch!"
"Oh My Damn! <at>sixers outscored 47-15 by <at>warriors in the 3rd QT. Lord Have Mercy!"
"Watching the end of this <at>ChicagoBears vs <at>Lions game. Snap? Perfect! Hold? Perfect! Kick by Connor Barth? Beyond atrocious. Waaaaay wife right. Wasted damn-good closing drive by Trubisky. So sad how kickers can ruin a game."
"Not surprised at all the <at>Vikings beat the <at>RamsNFL either. Their defense is big time. <at>RamsNFL offense? I needed to see them against a defense like this to believe. Came in w/ questions about Rams & left w/ them, too."
"As for the <at>Redskins I figured they’d show up today and play. Nobody’s thinking about them, so there’s no pressure. They wait for expectations to actually wet the bed and disappoint you."
"Although <at>Saints just scored another TD and pulled within 31-29. Now they need the 2-pt conversion"
"The GREAT Drew Brees is 11-for-11 on last two drives after <at>Saints trailed 31-16 with under 5 min left. Now they’ve scored on 2-pt conversion. Game tied 31-31. Let’s see what <at>Redskins do now."
"Now <at>Saints can’t get a stop when they need it. <at>Redskins in field goal range to win it. <at>Saints’ defense? Who Dat!"
"Intentional grounding by Kirk Cousins. WTH! Cost <at>Redskins 10 yards and 10. Stupid mistake by Cousins, who’s been otherwise great today. We’re going to OT, y’all"
"Ingram is running all over the <at>Redskins right now. They’re either worn out or simply can’t stop him. Gruden looks lost on the sidelines. Understood. <at>Saints just won the game. As great as Cousins was, couldn’t stop bleeding when it counted."
"BTW......<at>Redskins are officially done, for all of you who were wondering."
"Osweiler just flung a football into middle of the field w/looking. Lucky it wasn’t intercepted. Dude is so lucky. I see certain guys in this league QBing, and it just makes me think more about <at>Kaepernick7. <at>KingJames knows he’s blackballed like rest of us."
"The <at>buffalobills’ rookie QB — who Tyrod Taylor was benched for — has thrown 3 Int’s in his first 9 passes, all in the First Quarter. Experiment/Risk by McDermott isn’t looking go good right now"
"My bad. Petersen has FOUR — Yes, 4 — interceptions for the Bills. I know he’s just a rookie, but if you’re going to bench Tyrod Taylor, it doesn’t need to be for someone who’s doing things we haven’t seen done since 2002."
"What a disastrous day for the the <at>buffalobills. Petermen’s FIVE interceptions and subsequent benching leaves McDermott with an awful lot of explaining to do. The <at>RAIDERS disastrous tendencies need to be addressed to"
"Perhaps someone can explain to me how the <at>Patriots are suppose to have this awful defense — although it’s improved — and yet <at>derekcarrqb and the <at>RAIDERS can’t score a single damn point? What has happened to these guys?"
"H Lord. Brock Osweiler has the ball, needing to go 80 yards for a <at>Broncos win or about 45 to 50 yards for a tying FG. Why is it that I have ZERO faith in him?"
"4-and-out! No doubt adding insult to the loss, Vontaze Burfict goes over and hugs Osweiler after he flops, as if to say: “Thank You Brock....for being YOU.”Damn!!!"
"Btw.......I know Osweiler and Burfict are friends. Wasn’t speaking to Burfict’s intent. Just that folks who may not know they’re friends may have looked at it differently, because of how little Osweiler is thought of"
"Daaaaammmmmmnnnit! <at>Eagles give up 61-Yards on opening <url>e on! Damn!"
"Yeah! Yeah! Eagles = Touchdown."
"Int not on Dak. That was about Bell —- Dallas’ latest experiment at left tackle — getting beat and Dak having to rush pass. Ball tipped too. Don’t matter. Garrett and Linehan have to resolve that. Question is: Are they capable"
"You’ve gotta be kidding me. Elliott - a Damn practice squad player - misses gimme FG after interception. <url>e away with nothing! Damn! Damn! Damn!"
"Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhh Haaaaaa!!!! How ‘Bout Dem Cowboys!!!!!!! I’m out y’all. This game is a rap. See y’all tomorrow on <at>FirstTake.....and The Stephen A. Smith Show on ESPN Radio. This will be an ALL DAY AFFAIR. Haaaaaaa!!!!!!!"

"I’m about to do a Facebook Live post right now. I’m pissed off!"

"Oh Hell Yes! There’s a lot to talk about today. <at>KingJames. Fizdale’s Firing. <at>KDTrey5 on <at>Kaepernick7 and being BLACK in America. And then some. <at>FirstTake is in the house on ESPN. And so am I. Hell Yeah!"

"Two players later, though, Ryan connects under pressure. Good makeup job."
"Yep. The <at>Eagles look as if they’re about to pull away. The score here and it’s a wrap. Remember: <at>AtlantaFalcons don’t win games when they don’t score 20 or more. Matt Ryan will need <url>e up with something."
"Not Matt Ryan’s daily on that last play. Julio Jones falls down. 4th & Goal on the 2-Yard line with a playoff game on the line....you look for your best guy first. Falling down happens. But if you’re Julio, you just can’t let that happen to you. Game over!"
"Damn! Damn! Damn! Big Ben intercepted AGAIN by <at>Jaguars. Damn!"
"And BTW......hey Mike Mitchell, where are you? Ya see why you don’t look ahead to the <at>Patriots??? Sh&$! Game might be over already. Damn!!!!"
"What in the hell are the <at>steelers doing?? Why are they running sweeps against a defense with this speed? You’re less than a yard away. How about a QB sneak? Or to LeVeon right up the middle? Damn!!"
"Why is Mike Mitchell even talking to Leonard Fournette. Better yet: why don’t the <at>Jaguars just give Fournette the ball? It’s not like the damn <at>steelers can stop him. I can’t believe how disappointing this is. I’m so disgusted."
"I’m a damn <at>steelers fan an I’m telling you I cannot believe how much they are getting clubbed. This is an ASS WHIPPING right now. I’m almost ready to turn off my television."
"I swear I’m going to lose it if I see one more <at>steelers celebrating a mere first down. Get the Hell in the End Zone first. Damn!"
"Now celebrate, damnit! And I’m only talking about <at>AB84. Nobody else. Not even Big Ben, despite the TD throw. And I damn sure better not see Mitchell or anyone else on the <at>steelers defense celebrating. Them damn dudes haven’t even shown up yet"
"Okay! Okay! I like that TD to LeVeon from Big Ben. But it doesn’t mean a damn thing if the <at>steelers’ defense doesn’t figure out how to stop Fournette and the <at>Jaguars’ offense. What’s up Mike Mitchell? Let’s Go!"
"Yep. 28 of the <at>Jaguars’ 35 points came from their offense. But Mike Mitchell wants us to believe this defense is guaranteed to go to Foxborough and beat the <at>Patriots. #ChildPlease"
"Now <at>steelers’ D...whatcha gonna do? Man-The-Hell-Up! Stop somebody! Damn!!!!"
"This is officially embarrassing. The <at>steelers defense has given up 35 of 42 pts to a BLAKE BORTLES offense. You see why you needed to keep quiet <at>iammikemitchell? Even if you play well, you can’t speak for everybody. 35 Damn points! Boy do I long for the days of STEEL CURTAIN!"
"These <at>steelers. Can’t even do an on-side kick right. I personally had no problem with the attempt — even if you do have two timeouts left — but MY GOODNESS. Boswell can’t do an on-side kick right? Ridiculous."
"This was a disgraceful performance by the <at>steelers’ defense. They never - ever - showed up. And I’m driving this right in the lap of Mike Mitchell who, at least, APPEARED to look right past the <at>Jaguars. Trust is point to #’s all day but the <at>steelers haven’t had smite D in yrs"
"The <at>steelers totally looked past the <at>Jaguars. And the defense is responsible. Big Ben showed up, despite mistakes. <at>AB84 showed. <at>LeveonbeII showed up. But their defense didn’t. No Steel Curtain in the Steel City. That’s what happened."
"Great kick by Forbath. Kudos! But 1:29 is plenty of time for Drew Brees to get <at>Saints in FG Range. No.2 offense vs. No.1 Defense. Im<at>nervous but I believe in Brees!!!"
"Yeah! Like I said: I BELIEVE in Drew Brees. No matter what happens over these last 25 seconds, he did his job!!!!"
"This mistake by Marcus WILLIAMS — missing that play on Stefon Diggs — May be the absolute WORST MISTAKE I’ve ever seen in NFL Post-Season History. If it’s not THE worst it’s certainly up there. All the man had to do is make a tackle and the game is over. Horrible, Horrible Error."

"Right now Towns is too emotional. <at>Nuggets just need to play through Jokic. He’s scoring from everywhere, plus he’s savvy enough to fouls KAT out of there. Stupid for Denver to go through anyone else right now."
"Plus, Jokic has made his last four 3-pt attempts. Jimmy Butler just missing two FT’s didn’t help Minny. And now this kid Murray just pulled up for a 3. It’s 99-99 with 2:51 left.#LovingThis"
"Horrible possession by <at>nuggets with chance to take the lead. Tried too hard to force it to Jokic on one possession. Next possession he forced underhand scoop. <at>Wolves don’t take advantage b/c of 2 forced ones by Butler. Tied with 4.4 left. Denver Ball."
"Fantastic Defense on Jokic by Taj Gibson, strips Jokic in left corner, maintains possession, calls timeout. Score is tied 101 with 1.6 seconds left. This needs to put AND1 — Jamal Crawford in NOW."
"Crawford launches it from near halfcourt. Launches ill-advised heave. Had enough time to get a better shot. No matter. It’s overtime in Minny"
"I like Barton. But he’s done nothing for <at>nuggets since the first half. It’s looking like Denver missed its chance. But there’s still plenty of time."

"Uh oh! <at>Mathieu_Era gets tipped interception at <at>Patriots 17-yard line. <at>HoustonTexans in good spot but Watson holding onto ball too long. Plus, at least 3 Texans already hurt in this game; precisely what plagued them last year. Something to watch"
"What the hell is going on with Tampa? Ryan Fitzpatrick just ran in for a TD. Bucs Up 14-10"
"Speaking of TD’s, perfect thrown from Kirk Cousins to Stefon Diggs. Absolutely perfect throw. This is why they guaranteed Cousins $84-mil. Let’s see if it continues"
"I can’t believe I’m saying this but Ryan Fitzpatrick is putting on a show. Is that him and tamp’s receivers? Or is the <at>Saints defense more suspect than we were willing to recognize? Let’s see"
"This <at>steelers offense is looking real suspect in my eyes. Just can’t seem to make anything happen."
"I take it back. James Conner busted WALKED in on a TD run. <at>steelers we’re helped by a roughing the passer penalty, but who gives a damn. I’ll take what I can get. Steelers Up 7-0"
"Patriots go up 14-3. Sick of us acting like there’s some suspense. Screens. Dips & Dunks. To Hogan. To Dorsett. To Gronk. It just doesn’t matter. They’re a well-oiled machine. They just get it done. And the <at>HoustonTexans offense hasn’t done a damn-impressive thing yet."
"DeShaun Watson: 8 drop backs. Sacked once and hurried 5 times."
"Nice throw just now from Watson to Jordan Thomas in 1-on-1 coverage. TE is a big boy. Watson should use him more."
"Another int by Big Ben. Looks like receiver ran wrong route, though. Still, this is what you get when you help run Todd Haley out if town. Too many times, folks act like we’ve got to have Thanksgiving Dinner together or exchange Christmas Gifts to work together. Just do the job!"
"Uh, Hello: Andrew Luck is balling. 14-for-19, 146 yards, 1 TD. He’s back"
"The <at>49ers are in a 1st & Goal situation due to yet another holding penalty vs <at>XavierRhodes29_ . He is BIGTIME, but that’s the one bad part about him that he’s got to fix."
"Doesn’t matter. <at>49ers 14-play drive gone because Alfred Morris gets stripped by Linval Joseph and the 1-yard line. <at>Vikings recover. Defense is still bigtime, showing why they were no.1 last season until the last 6-quarters we saw them in the playoffs."
"Damnit! <at>deshaunwatson just floats the ball into the end zone for an interception. What the hell us going on? Again, <at>HoustonTexans look lost offensively. <at>DeAndreHopkins is nowhere to be found thus far. We’ll see, but totally unimpressive this far"
"Btw.....Jags defense all over the <at>Giants. They can’t seem to do anything right now. ELI a virtual stationary target"
"Gotta admit, I like what I’m seeing from Kirk Cousins. But it IS the regular season, so I won’t sweat it too much"
"Wish I could say I like what I’m seeeing from Big Ben. Bad conditions, plus bad plays fro receivers. But still: Big Ven has 3 But’s in the first half. Not good. That’s just not good!"
"Btw......with the <at>Browns doing absolutely nothing offensively, it’ll be interesting to see if Hue Jackson just says “To Hell With It All” and elects to put in <at>bakermayfield and bench <at>TyrodTaylor. Im<at>not wishing that on Tyrod at all. Just pointing out that ya just never know!"
"WTH is is going on? Ryan Fitzpatrick has let the <at>Buccaneers to 31-First Half points. My goodness!"
"Great touch throw from Joe Flacco to Michael Crabtree, who tap danced in the back of the end zone. <at>Ravens look good, but it’s against the <at>buffalobills - who’s thrown their season but just won’t admit it to the rest of us. Anyone who starts Pederman is doing just that!#AwfulTeam"
"55 points in the scoreboard in the first half of <at>Buccaneers vs <at>Saints. Same ole Saints (No defense. Everything on Drew Brees’ Shoulders). Different Day"
"Manning just had <at>OBJ_3 open — had him matched up vs a safety. But ELI missed him, for the 2nd time today. This keeps up and it’ll be clear that Eli’s the one who has to get it together. Odell speed, etc. is there. Not on him."
"Btw.....Carlos Hyde is running the ball effectively vs <at>steelers, averaging better than 4-yds per carry. But guess what: so is 2nd-round pick, Nick Chubb. We’ll see how this works out."
"Awwwww Damn! <at>TyrodTaylor just rushes from about 20- yards out for a TD. <at>Browns rushed for about 70-damn yards on that drive. These damn Steelers are really annoying me right now."
"Another Fitzpatrick to Evans hookup. <at>Buccaneers down near <at>Saints 5-yard line. Just doing what they want offensively. Saints’ defense looking pathetic right now. Just pathetic."
"Uh Huh! Jimmy G just threw a Pick-6. Receiver DUD fall down, but the throw was getting intercepted anyone because it wasn’t near the receiver, period. I know <at>MollyQerim  won’t want to admit that about her 2nd favorite WB, but it’s absolutely true."
"There is a legitimate chance that this year’s <at>buffalobills may be the WORST NFL team we’ve seen this decade. Forget records (the 0-16teams in Detroit & CLEVELAND in recent memory. I’m not talking record. I’m just saying they are God-Awful. Is there any worse than Peterman?#Lordy"
"No surprises here: the pick-6 off a deflected pass by ELI Manning started with a tackle blowing by RT Erick Flowers. Good Lord! It just never ends with this guy"
"There is a caller into the Stephen A. Smith radio show named “Carlton,” based out of Tampa. There is no bigger fan of Ryan Fitzpatrick that I know of. I can only imagine how he’s feeling right now, with Bucs having now dropped 48pts on Saints — and counting. #LordHaveMercy!"
"Wow! <at>saquon just busted out the gates and ran for a 68-yard TD run. Before this moment, he was only averaging 2.3 yards per carry. Still, a question: he was clearly out of gas after the 68-yarder. So why the hell does Shurmur give the man the ball in the 2-pt conversion?#Idiotic"
"Garrappolo overthrows Kittle from<at>the inside slot. He was open. He missed it. He may be good. This is the <at>Vikings defense. But like I said: he’s no Tom Brady. Let the man prove something first place. Thank you very mich"
"Ummm, something necessary to point out: <at>OBJ_3 has 11 receptions today. 11. I know <at>jalenramsey didn’t say anything about Beckham, but he did say something about the person throwing him the ball: ELI. Still love Ramsey though. Brother is special."
"Botched handle on punt by some dude named Clay finishes off <at>Giants"
"Jimmy Garrappolo gets ball with over a minute and a half left, with a chance to tie, then proceeds to throw the ball RIGHT INTO COVERAGE to Smith for the int. His 3rd INT in the day. Need I say anymore?
He can play. I’m wishing him luck. But I tried to tell y’all: not yet!"
"It’s only his 8th-career start. Shame on all those who tried to act like he’s the <url>ing if Brady. Pump the damn brakes."
"Suttton intercepts <at>TyrodTaylor, making up for the touchdown he gave up to Josh Gordon earlier. Btw.....happy as hell to see Gordon catch that TD. So special. Wishing him all the luck. But the <at>steelers had better not lose this game. It’s embarrassing enough GM is in OT."
"Awwww S<at>&$! <at>Chiefs looking prophetic in their praise for <at>PatrickMahomes5. He just connected on a 58-yarder to Tyreek Hill off a slant pattern. Chiefs up 14-3."
"The <at>Browns just got a sack. Are the <at>steelers offensive line going to blame <at>LeVeonBell for that too?? Next point in OT wins this game. Why do I suspect the <at>steelers is going to blow this? If they do, I’ll be looking for my man Ryan Clark tomorrow on <at>FirstTake"
"Gotta say: this kid <at>denzelward has been BALLIN for the <at>Browns all afternoon. I’m thoroughly impressed with this kid. Maybe we should stop talking if waiting for <at>bakermayfield and start paying more attention to this rookie."
"Yep! <at>Earl_Thomas misses all of training camp, practices less than a week, yet steps right in, reads Case Keenum like a book for the int, and sets up <at>Seahawks First TD."
"After that magnificent running from Cam Newton, the drive gets ruined near the goal line because Christian McCaffrey gets stripped. <at>dallascowboys ball."
"Just need to Big Ben hit from behind. Another int. <at>Browns kick FG to win the damn game. I’m sick to my stomach. If the lose this game, it’ll be their largest blown 4th-QT lead in a loss in team history."
"FG blocked. Scored tied with :13 left. I freakin HATE TIES. Play until you drop damnit. Can’t stand this. This is a rule the NFL needs to change. Who gives a damn about a tie? No winners or losers! Sunday afternoon in Cleveland and Pitssburgh just wasted."
"Tyrell WILLIAMS just dropped a wide-open TD pass from Phillip Rivers. He may be some practice squad success story, but if he doesn’t make it for that....that’s exactly where he’ll find himself back to. He’s better hope Rivers throws him the ball again."
"The <at>Panthers have had heat in <at>dak all afternoon. Don’t know why Garrett decides to go for it on 4th & 10...having one of the best punters, plus timeouts. But then again, what do I care. It’s the damn <at>dallascowboys we’re talking about here. Haaaaaaaa!!!!!!!"
"Yep! <at>Panthers did it again. See, this is what we were <url>ing into the season: can Dan really handle it when it’s on his shoulders? So far — dating back to last season AND this one — the answer is NO!!!! Hey y’all: How ‘Bout Dem Cowboys!” Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"No place for <at>dak to throw. No place for <at>EzekielElliott to run. And remember folks, I’m being very nice. I didn’t say a word about Randy Gregory😀😀😀😀😀😀😀"
"By the way.....it’s just one week. But I’m willing to go so far as to call <at>Chiefs all-purpose star, Tyreek Hill, THE MOST EXPLOSIVE player in the NFL. He’s THAT soecial"
"Man, I can’t wait to address this subject on First Take tomorrow. What are y’all thoughts? <url>"

"<at>NeilSamra1 <at>52Mack_ <at>rcobb18 I can’t stand your ass, either. How about that? As big as Mack is, did you not see him collapse in the end zone once he missed the tackle? Needed a damn oxygen mask after. But here you are talking about hustle. Sit your ass down :-)"

"It was a shame we missed all of these players on Sunday... <url>"
"Somebody had to say it. <url>"
"Good Lord! The very first play of Sam Darnold’s career, he throws a puck-6 to Diggs. Why the hell are you throwing an ACROSS-THE-FIELD PASS? Jesus! This ain’t USC! Actually, maybe he still thinks it is. Lions 7, Jets 0. #MyGoodness"
"Good drive by <at>nyjets. Good throws from Darnold, good runs by Powell and Crowell. If Jets keep this power game going, who knows. Let’s find out what the <at>Lions under Matt Patricia are made of."
"What did y’all just see: Morris Claiborne leap and intercept Matthew Stafford? Or Stafford — one of the highest paid players in the league - reminding you, yet again, that he’s never won a playoff game in his decade-long career?"
"Sam Darnold did go to college for a couple of years, right? How difficult is it <url>prehend that you don’t take sacks in the red zone? This is the second tome he’s done it this gane"
"BIGTIME throw by Darnold. He’s 4-for-4 on 3rd Downs. Whoa! Very impressive. Unless you want to look at Patricia and say: yet another Belichick coordinator who won’t pan out"
"Another interception by Matthew Stafford. His 3rd. This time a pick-6. Awful! At some point we’ve got to ask ourselves why in the hell is a QB that’s never win a playoff game getting paid more than $27-mil per. I guess the answer would be: Be a use Kirk Cousins is making $28 mil"
"ANOTHER damn interception. What a God-Awful performance by Stafford. Matt Patricia has to be saying: “I can’t believe I left Tom Brady for this.” He <url>pletely shook and I don’t blame him. <at>nyjets LB’s are just laying back in coverage, daring Stafford to throw.#Embarrassing"
"This is the kind of performance that should make ALL NFL teams pause at the thought of hiring a Belichick disciple! Patricia’s very first game and this is how they look."
"Gotta admit, that drive by the <at>Raiders was special, especially that finish by Beastmode and that offensive line. That’s the way you start out a new era. That score personifies Gruden. Gotta give credit where is due. Now let’s see how this <at>Raiders Defense does!"

"Hey! <at>GGG round 1 because if his jab. <at>Canelo gets round 2 because of power shots, speed, and the swelling developing in <at>GGG left side of face because of it"
"2-2 after 4. Gave 3rd round to Canelo and 4th to GGG. Jabs. A couple of body shots. And finally pushed Canelo back"
"Yep! <at>GGG gets Round 5. Using jab. <at>Canelo stalking but not connecting. He’s better when he’s countering. Not attacking. At least not yet"
"That’s 3  rounds to 2 for <at>GGGBoxing"
"Round 6 was even. Both got off decent shots. I still say: <at>Canelo is hurting himself by backing up. He’s at his best countering. Not being the aggressor"
"I see what <at>Canelo is doing though. <at>GGG is the older man. Attack the body and hope he wears down"
"I gave <at>Canelo round 7. Power shots early propelled him. But <at>GGG is using that jab. <at>Caneko is trying to do what <at>FloydMayweather did to <at>TheNotoriousMMA: walk him down. Stay in his chest. Take leverage off those shots"
"I give Round 8 to <at>GGG. Less power shots but more jabs and solid shots connected. <at>Canelo cut over left eye. But <at>GGG looks tired"
"I gave <at>Canelo Round 9. Power shots connected. <at>GGG <url>ing. When he uses the jab he’s very effective and <at>Canelo struggles. But other wise <at>Canelo has advabtage"
"Round 10 goes to <at>GGG. Hurt <at>Canelo with right, then a flurry. <at>Canelo started off round strong but faded too much. Now he might be getting tired. Lighter weight costing him????"

"Yessssss!!!!!!! Great play by MacDonald. Conte should be embarrassed."
"You know what: it looks like I could throw the damn ball vs. this <at>steelers secondary. I have no idea how they’re going to stop this <at>Buccaneers offense. They might score 50 in this defense."

"Yeeaahhhhhh! Tip by Bostic on errant throw from Fitzpatrick for <at>steelers 2nd INT of the game. <at>steelers forcing <at>Buccaneers to methodically go down field instead of getting big play and it’s working. Is Fitzpatrick returning to old form? Sure looks like it. #Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

"Damn! Damn! Damn! The <at>steelers offense cannot continue to miss these opportunities. This is not going to cut it."

"I gave Fury that first round. Made a wild Wilder miss. Used his jab. Again, Wilder too wild. Needs to calm down and use his jab....set up the right"
"I gave Wilder Round 2 because of a couple of power punches, but still don’t like what I’m seeing. Fury is moving well and using his jab. Wilder’s jab could be sharper. He’s gone away from the body already and is head-hunting"
"I gave round 3 to Fury. Caught Wilder twice, plus is just doing a better job of boxing — hitting, moving while using his jab. Fury up 2 rounds to 1."
"Round 4 to Wilder. But Fury is still making him miss all night with that right. Except this time Fury didn’t connect on anything either. Fury is clearly the better boxer thus far. Just didn’t throw enough punches that round."
"Again, Wilder missing more than connecting. Can buy a right-connect, or a left-hook or haymaker, for that matter. But I still give him the edge because of activity. Fury’s just evading moreso than fighting."
"Fury gets round 6. Here’s the problem: Wilder has got to get on the inside. Fury <url>fortable standing outside and pity-patting him to death. And Wilder is throwing <url>binations. He hasn’t caught Fury with a power punch in the last 3 rounds. It’s like he’s waiting 4 R-Hand."
"Fury again. He’s winning this fight right now. Wilder relying on big shots, but can’t connect on any of them. He’s getting outboxed, plain and simple. Plus, his left eye is swelling up. Fury is doing precisely what he came on <at>FirstTake and told me he’d do."
"Wilder connected late with a rare power shot but still lost the round. Fury actually looks fresher at this point, too."
"Fury goes down in the 9th. Wilder gets the round 10-8, but if you can believe it Fury gets up and looks fresher than Wilder. Stunned Wilder with <url>ing in and that paused everything. Wilder looks exhausted."
"Fury wins Round 10. Boxed, moved. Wilder barely threw a punch until the round was over. Wilder has to win 11 & 12th to win this fight"
"Fury again. Just out-Boxing Wilder. Jabs and sharp punches. Wilder answers by punching air. Can’t find Fury. Needs KO to win."
"Ref helped Fury survive in the end. Fight should’ve been stopped in 10 sec. but since it finished, despite the 2-point round, Fury wins by a point — despite getting dropped twice."
"What a great, great call by Nagy for the <at>ChicagoBears to tie the game at the end of regulation. <url>e back from a 10-point deficit with less than 90 sec left. <at>obj didn’t go after on-side kick and <at>Giants defense didn’t get stops. Just encapsulates their whole season.#Mess"

"That is some straight BULLSHIT!!!!! Too late on the pass interference call. Questionable, too. I swear these damn refs make me sick. They’re trying to rob my <at>steelers.#Damn! Damn!Damn!"
"Straight B.S. but that’s ok. <at>steelers now have enough time. A FG to tie or a TD to win. Go for the damn win. I would’ve let them score once they were at the1-yard line anyways. Now Big Ben, handle your damn business. Still mad about fake FG attempt though."

(credit: <at>hasunow) <url>"
"It’s just 1 game. A regular-season game at that. But it’s important to say: The <at>Lakers are WAXING the <at>Warriors. I mean kicking their you-know-what. WithOUT <at>KingJames in the floor, and against <at>KDTrey5, <at>StephenCurry30 who are playing.#Damn!"
"Thank you <at>UPROXX for spending the day with me. Check out the piece! <url>"
"Oh Hell No! I do not want to hear this about John Wall. Look, I’m not about to question the legitimacy of his left heel injury. Hell, I won’t even question that it might be best he have season-ending surgery. But where was this when he dropped 40 on the Lakers? Why now...."
"All these damn players want to get paid like they’re shining but where’s the shine? Against the Cavs? Against the Nets? Against the freakin Atlanta Hawks, for crying out loud??? 
Y’all can go ahead and join hands in prayer that Wall gets better, 100% healthy."
"But I’m hoping for more than that. I’m hoping this brother returns IN SHAPE, ready to validate that $170 mil he’s about to get over the next 4 seasons......instead of leaving us wondering if he’s calling it a season because he ain’t about to make an All-Star team..."
"....with the Wizards looking like trash half the time? Is the pressure too much???
See why we should love LeBron James? No matter what, he shows up. Each and every single season! In Shape! Ready to perform! Getting paid mega-dough but playing like he’s broke."
".....and the Wizards damn-sure ain’t making the playoffs. That’s my two cents. Bye! I’m heading back on my vacation. #CantBelieveThis"
"Haaaaaaa <url>"
"Hey <at>ChaseHughesNBCS, just saw your tweet regarding <at>JohnWall. Quote this: I don’t want to hear a damn thing from Wall about talking to him man-to-man. I showed at one game and waited for him in the locker room; he <url>e out. I showed up again when they played <at>celtics"
"And <at>JohnWall still didn’t want to talk, <at>ChaseHughesNBCS. I’ve said nothing to take back and I damn sure don’t hide from anyone. What I said about Wall not being in great shape and struggling periodically was FACT. His appearance at the Rose Bar was courtesy of TMZ, not me!"
"And as for my questioning the timing of <at>JohnWall possibly having surgery, that’s what we feel as fans from witnessing what’s unfolded over this season. Wall knows me. Rich Paul knows me. And there isn’t a soul in sports who doesn’t know how to find me. Any time <at>ChaseHughesNBCS"
"So the next time <at>JohnWall or any player tells you they are looking for me for a man to-man convo, <at>ChaseHughesNBCS, tell them to name the time and place and I’ll show up. I’d <url>e it...even on my damn vacation. I’m not the one hiding. Never have! Never will!"

"I’m going to give this much to my man, <at>damienwoody, filling in on <at>FirstTake today: at least he knew better than sitting in MY CHAIR without a damn tie on. He knows better, so I’ll give him credit for that much.#BeRESPECTFUL!"
"Well Congrats coach Blatt. You really stepped out there with that take. So I’m “clueless” because I believed the Phoenix Suns should take a 7’1” talent from right up the road for a 19-year-old talent I acknowledged having never seen? Okay! I’ll take the jab. But with a question:"

"Yo Iguodala, <at>JHarden13 ain’t the guy you try to flop against. Because if you don’t get the call — which you likely won’t — that’s more space for him to drill a 3.....which he did."
"Everyone has mad respect for the <at>warriors. But I don’t see the FEAR that once existed. Without that intimidation factor, things could get really interesting once the playoffs begin"
"The <at>HoustonRockets got hosed on the play. <at>KDTrey5 had both feet out of bounds and in the yellow. Couldn’t be more out of bounds on that save. Refs missed it. <at>StephenCurry30 hits jumper to put <at>warriors up 134-132. Could cost  them game"
"OMG!!! OMG!!!  <at>JHarden13 pulls up for big-time 3 on both <at>KlayThompson & <at>Money23Green with 1-Second left in OT. He has 44pts, ladies & gentleman. The Best scorer in the game, the reigning MVP, just won the game......putting on a show. This brother is unreal, and special."

"The <at>RamsNFL are really ticking me off right now very predictable. Too many running plays. No play-action utilizing Gurley or anyone else. This is playing right into the <at>dallascowboys hands. And I haven’t even begun to talk about how LA’s defense is looking."
"Haaaaaaaaa! I’m sooooo sorry I have to say this, but it’s a necessary message for the FANS....not the team that did have a good season: How ‘Bout Dem <at>dallascowboys! Haaaaaaaaaaaa! Take y’all asses HOME, Cowboys fans"

"The <at>Patriots are hitting Ohillip Rivers at every turn. Flowers is bulldozing through <at>Chargers off. Line. Plus, Rivers arm doesn’t appear strong enough to make accurate throws outside the numbers down field. It’s just all falling apart before our very eues"
"Rough day for King. Getting burned in coverage. Getting penalized. And now fumbling a punt return. <at>Patriots about to close these boys out, barring a miracle. What a disgraceful performance by the <at>Chargers."
"The GREAT Jim Nance just brought up the <at>Chargers traveling back from Baltimore, then back to New England. But I agree with Romo: the <at>Patriots are just physically abusing these boys. Should’ve stuck to my guns: Cali team too soft for cold <url>e playoff time.#GameOver"
"Who’s the <at>Chargers defensive coordinator? Gus Bradley? Boy does he have some explaining to do. Then again, the <at>Patriots have 5 TD’s. The <at>Chargers have 5 first downs. That’s just pure domination = Belichick over 2-year coach Anthony Lynn."
"Btw.....this is really not on Phillip Rivers. He’s not getting ANY protection. Off. Line are missing blocked left and right. The <at>Chargers are looking like we suspected. Looks like a lot of us got hoodwinked. A miracle now qualifies as the game simply <url>petitive.#Damn"

"I would love for the <at>Chiefs to win this game. But I will say this: they’re very lucky this is only 7-0. They’ve been thoroughly outclassed this far. Halfway thru 2nd QT: they’ve only run 8 plays. Have minute-2 yards. Haven’t gotten past their own 30-yard line. Damn!"

"Yyyyteeeeahhhh! <at>TigerWoods. I can’t believe it. I can’t believe he did it. Never thought I see this day again. Congratulations! Golf is officially back"
"What amazes me about this <at>TigerWoods victory wasn’t his patience and poise in avoiding the mistakes on 12 that Molinari and others made. It’s that I thought he was emotionally finished. Too much time spent on what others thought, plus the injuries. But he did it. So amazing."
"And if ever there was an athlete who personified perseverance, about <url>ing trials and tribulations, it is <at>TigerWoods today. I never thought he’d win a major again. Now I think he’s gonna surpass him. HE’s the shark in blood-infected waters. Everyone else is the prey!#UhOh"

"However, the <at>nuggets are pulling a <at>HoustonRockets Game 7 performance from last year: they can’t buy a 3-pt basket to save their lives. Can’t hit anything. Youthful guards we’ve spent all season bragging about can’t do anything right now."

"I watched the fight 3x. Look, Ruiz is good. Solid boxer. Fast hands. But everyone’s missing the point: THE FIGHT we were all waiting for — Wilder vs. Joshua — is officially ruined. No one with sense believes Joshua has a chance vs him now, even if he goes back and beats Ruiz."

"Because the loss robbed us of the magnitude a MEGAFIGHT gives us <at>Canelo. How do YOU of all ppl not know that? You gave us you vs GGG. You didn’t make us wait. So this isn’t about knowing boxing. This is about Boxing continuing to rob us of the fights we want WHEN we want them."

"The <at>Raptors are up 43-38. And right now, Lowry just looks absolutely exceptional. Making 3’s. Running the office. Moving the BBall. Siakam & Van Vleet are making shots, too. The <at>warriors will not win this game unless the figure out Lowry."
"Yes! <at>KlayThompson was suppose to be done. But then he wasn’t. Carried off the court one minute, ran right out the next. He said: “Hell No! I’m not going out like this!” <url>"
"Here was what I was talking about <url>"
"Congratulations! No matter what, the <at>Raptors deserve credit. Focused. Poised. And they played together. <url>"

<url>"
"Yes! I’m off vacation. Back on <at>FirstTake on a Monday. Watching this fight right now. Got <at>MannyPacquiao winning first 3 rounds. Thurman gets around 4. Strangely, seems to be wearing Pacman down a touch, but who knows"
"Oh Damn! Thurman got beat up in that round. <at>MannyPacquiao is all over him. Has his nose bleeding. Thurman was hurt in around 5. Manny’s footwork is impressive. He looks faster. Uh Oh!"
"Thurman gets round 6"
"Just busier in Round 6. I’m waiting for <at>MannyPacquiao to get tired so Thurman can find him. But it’s not looking that way right now. It’s Boxing, though. One punch can change everything."
"I gave <at>MannyPacquiao the 7th because of that late charge and have him ahead 5 rounds to 2. But Thurman has been most effective when he’s moving and making Pacman chase."
"Plain and Simple: Thurman needs a knockout to win this fight. Period. Not a knockDOWN. He needs a knockOUT"
"I’ve got <at>MannyPacquiao winning this fight 8 rounds to 4. 116-112"
"Should not have even been a split decision. <at>MannyPacquiao outclassed him most of the fight, period. Wasn’t even close. At least the final decision was the right now. But if Pacman knows what’s good for him, he’ll stay away from <at>terencecrawford  and <at>ErrolSpenceJr. I know THAT!"

"Here's what I'm saying about Jay-Z partnering with the NFL... <url>"
"Fair enough <at>E_Reid35. But you weren’t advocating for him to keep it either. You were advocating for something far greater than that — something that transcends you and Kap — which is why you both deserve our profound respect & gratitude. But how about seeing what Jay does 1st! <url>"
"......before condemning the man? Kap said he wanted action. You co-signed that. So let’s see what he actually does. You basically calling him a sellout is low. There’s more than 1 way to skin a cat. You way warrants respect. But it ain’t the ONLY. Think about that please. <url>"
"Sorry folks. Not taking the bait. While I believe <at>E_Reid35 could handle certain situations better (I.e. Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z), I will never disrespect this man. He’s fighting for US. I can disagree with his approach and still maintain Profound Respect for him, which I do. <url>"
"He is more than entitled to call my position ludicrous. <at>E_Reid35 has earned the right to do that. He’s good with me. I have no idea how he feels about me. Nor do I care. But I respect him and what he’s trying to do for US. Period! <url>"
"True! But I’m working on it :-) <url>"
"Guess who’s subbing for <at>MollyQerim today, filling in as Host on <at>FirstTake this morning: the WONDERFUL <at>ROSGO21. Tune in at the top of the hour. And YES! We’re finally back in ESPN for the full 2 hours"

"I have no doubt. But I’ve got some news for the Gauff’s: Coco won’t be the only one. They’ll be a significant part of history, too. What an absolutely beautiful family they are. And what a magnificent job they’re doing as parents. Kudos to the whole family. <url>"

"Damn right <url>"
"Haaaa <url>"
"I actually agree with you at this point <url>"

"Please <url>"
"Yes Sir <url>"
"Blessings bro <url>"
"Get drug tested immediately please <url>"
"Thank you sir. Much appreciated <url>"
"As I said earlier on <at>FirstTake, Antonio Brown has brought this on himself. All this noise is utterly ridiculous! <url>"
"Haaaaa! That must mean the brother is looking smooth :-) <url>"
"I figured: why wait to annoy Dallas Cowboys fans when I could start right now. <url>"
"I’m baaaaaaack <url>"
"Me years ago. RJ now. Who did it better? <url>"
"Bottom line: Jon Gruden looks weak as hell w/ this call. A 1-game suspension secures Raiders having freedom to cut ties w/ AB in event he continues to engage in insubordination — assuming reports are true — and you give that up??? That is just PATHETIC. Gruden will regret this."
"Boy I hope I’m wrong, but I can’t see it."
"Top 5 reasons the Cowboys ain’t winning the Super Bowl! <url>"
"The Biggest Crow I’ve ever eaten in my career at ESPN! <url>"
"<at>Raiders Right decision. You cannot act this way and get away with it. Maybe my man Max is right. Maybe there really is something wrong. AB fought all this time to make this money, then just threw it all away before playing a single game. Disgraceful."
"<at>Raiders He’s too great not to land with another team if he wants to. But his days of getting his money has <url>e to an end.#SoSad"
"Some folks are some damn fools! Y’all go ahead and applaud AB all y’all want. After chasing all that money, w/ security, he’s now playing ONE YEAR AT A TIME. Period. Don’t get me started. Man, I can’t wait for <at>FirstTake on Monday. <url>"
"That was just a damn-good TD pass from Foles. The <at>Jaguars didn’t see that in years with Blake Bortles as their  QB. This is what they paid Foles for. We’ll see if it continues."
"OMG. Lamar Jackson just connected with Brown on an 83-yard bomb for a TD. Perfect throw from Lamar. And this kid, Brown: a rookie. First 2 catches of NFL career=Both TD. Young brother is putting on a show. Horrible start for <at>MiamiDolphins, down 21-0 to <at>Ravens."
"MaHomes to Watkins on a drag route = 49-yard TD connection. Too many plays thus far where <at>chiefs receivers are wide open. Not the Jacksonville defense I expected. Oh, Btw, Nick Foles our for rest of game w/ shoulder injury on that TD throw. Damn!"
"Peeps, maybe it’s just that the <at>MiamiDolphins defense is just this bad. But y’all need to know: <at>Lj_era8 is putting on a damn show for the <at>Ravens. His throws are right on target. He’s flinging this football all over the field. If he runs & throws, God help rest of the NFL."
"Nice move by my man <at>tkelce for a 41-yard hookup from <at>PatrickMahomes. Again, Jags far less impressive than I expected. I know the <at>Chiefs offense is a juggernaut, but still. Btw.....MaHomes is now being helped off field. He’s limping"
"Also, one big surprise, another not so big: A.) <at>Redskins are kicking the <at>Eagles butt right in Philadelphia, 17-0. B.) No surprise at all that the Rams are all over Cam Newton. They’re only up 10-0, but Csm has been over-throwing or under-throwing in the 1st Half=No Surprise!"
"Just a disgraceful performance by the <at>MiamiDolphins. They’re down 42-3 BEFORE the half — at HOME — but that’s not the only reason. They are dropping passes left & right. Missing tackles, etc. Flores has his work cut out for him. Just a horrible performance."
"Okay <at>K1, I see you. I see you. 18 pets in the 4th QT for the <at>AZCardinals. Scored tied at 24 with seconds left. OT is about to arrive."
"Or maybe not. Matthew Stanford is good <url>ebacks during the regular season."
"Damn! Damn! Damn! You Big Ben, can you figure out a way to beat Brady is Foxboro ONE DAMN TIME! F$&<at>&)$&<at><at>&$!!!!!!"
"I've never seen selfishness like this. I just don’t want to hear a different opinion on this: <url>"

"I think <at>KDTrey5 is focused on being the best player in today's game, not necessarily history. <url>"
"<url>e to AMERICA!!!!! <url>"
"Loved hanging out with The <at>breakfastclubam. Appreciate their question about how I got started. <url>"
"Ain’t about being done tough guy bro. I simply pointed out how I though you were playing around a couple of years ago, and then YOU publicly stated what your real intent was AFTERWARD to someone in the media. So I said, had I known...it wouldn’t have gone down like that. Period! <url>"
"Nobody has any right to put there hands on someone. I’d like to believe you know that. I respect you — and your fam — as well as your right to not like me, etc. But putting your hands and someone, then claiming you actually wished harm, is different. So based on that I meant... <url>"
"What I said and I still mean it. If anyone puts their hands on you and talks Sh&$<at>, what would you say or <url>e on bro? I’ve got respect for you and your bro — like I said — but you know you had no business doing that......if you weren’t playing around. I thought you were! <url>"
"Now I know! <url>"
"Yes <at>cthagod asked me about my DAMN hairline! And he’s right: I just might need to let it all go :-) <url>"
"I’m not selling out. I’m looking out. <url>"
"I always do. You do the same bro. I’m not hiding. I’ve done nothing but show you and your brother the utmost respect. Always. And I’ve called it like I’ve seen it. You make sure you do the same and there won’t be any issues this way. <url>"
"Another clownish diatribe from Antonio Brown. But I’d still PLAY him....for now <url>"
"I saw this book title and couldn’t help but laugh and sympathize with the author, aka <at>RealSkipBayless’ wife. Y’all go check out the book! <url>"

"I said what I said! <url>"
"In <at>UMichFootball’s opening drive, we saw a WR devoid of breakaway speed, a QB that couldn’t connect on a slant pattern over the middle for a TD, and a RB (Mason) <url>mitted their 9th fumble of the season (6 lost). And we’re wondering why Harbaugh won’t win w/ these guys?"
"Damn great catch by <at>UMichFootball Ronnie Bell. Big time <url>pletely extended on that 22-yard catch. The kid can play. Ball can touch ground so long as <url>pletely secure so it should be ruled a catch. But again, the kid’s got skills."
"Just ruled a non-catch by <at>UMichFootball’s Bell. Bogus. Should’ve been a catch. This kid is the only thing I like about the Wolverines’ Offense right now."
"Good Lord. The first QT hasn’t even ended yet and <at>BadgerFootball’s Jonathan Taylor already has 2 TD’s and 143-yards rushing after just scampering for a 72-yard TD run. The way <at>UMichFootball Offense is looking, this game is already over. Can’t see <url>ing back."
"I’m done watching this <at>BadgerFootball vs <at>UMichFootball game. UM is getting DESTROYED. Beat like they stole something. This is embarrassing. So much for Harbaugh’s team having a chance this game. Just a joke. I’m done!"
"The <at>UMichFootball had 2 Damn Weeks to prepare for this game. Can’t stop the run. Can’t pressure. No discipline. And that’s just the defense. The offense is so much worse. They should be ashamed of the way they look. They can’t run. Can’t protect the QB. Just horrible.#Damn!"
"This means the world to me. <url>"
"Ladies & Gentlemen, in the interest of fairness I have an announcement to make, regardless of <url>e: the <at>Giants have a new QB. And his name is Daniel Jones. Helluva game thus far"
"I think it's over for Antonio Brown. Unless a personality transplant occurs. <url>"
"I think Jay Gruden just lost his job tonight. What a disgraceful performance by the <at>Redskins offense. This is <at>FiftyDeuce you’re going against. Why is he being covered 1-on-1. The <at>ChicagoBears are having their way. I guess you can blame injuries, but damn! Year-after-year."
"Here's what we learned about the Redskins. <url>"
"When that beat drops ... <url>"
"<at>REALDJPREMIER <at>gangstarr Haaaa. Thanks my man"
"<at>JabariJYoung My Brother. So.....So proud of you and all you’ve <url>plished. You make me proud every time I see your work. Keep grinding. Keep climbing. Keep setting that example. Love ya bro! See ya soon."
"It was truly an honor to bring <at>FirstTake to the <at>hbcuweek Career Fair. Delaware State University accepted more than 250 applicants on the spot and awarded well over $1 million in scholarships. There have been 100 Full Ride Scholarships awarded so far. (📹 via WITN Channel 22) <url>"
"It's fair to call Baker Mayfield overrated.......for NOW! <url>"
"Haaaaa. Thanks my man. <url>"
"Thank you <url>"
"You’re more than <url>e <url>"
"Stay off the WEEEEEED <url>"
"The best player in the world is still <at>KingJames. <url>"
"It ain’t about just smoking weed. It’s about LOSING money over doing it, DAMMIT! <url>"
"A few things to take notice from today’s games: the <at>Browns answered the call and showed out. They deserve their props. So do the <at>Lions, win, lose or draw, along with the <at>BuffaloBills. Haskins was thrown into the lions den and looked miserable. Shocked if Gruden isn’t gone 2day"
"Looks like Teddy Bridgewater just lost this damn game for the <at>Saints by allowing that sack.......unless the <at>Saints defense manages to hold......which I doubt. But we’ll see."
"<at>Saints Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!
Who Dat!!!!!!!!!! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!!!!!
To Hell with Dem Cowboys’ (Fans!!!"
"How about THEM Cowboys?!?!?! <url>"
"I blame the Cowboys' offense for the loss. <url>"
"Howdy and <url>e to the Stephen A. Smith Show 😉 <url>"
"Enjoyed chatting with <at>patrickbetdavid about my background, how I got into journalism, and much more! <url> <url>"
"This message goes out to <at>Matt_Barnes22 and <at>DaTrillStak5. <url>"
"Ahhhhhh this is TOUGH!!!! I gotta say, I think <at>SHAQ got the best of <at>Dame_Lillard this round!!!! <url>"
"What a game! What a game! Bases loaded, <at>Nationals down 3-1 and Soho smacks a single to right. Error by R-Fielder and 3 runs score, bottom of the 8th. Nats take a 3-1 lead. THIS is what October’s are made for"
"Haaaaaaa! Unreal.....about anyone in the world BUT Anthony Kornheiser. He probably said: “Damn, the Nats blew it again. Same ole, Same ole. I’m going to bed”.........in the top of the 8th inning 😀😀😀.  Hilarious. <url>"
"Y’all, the very beginning of the AL Wild Card Game is being streamed here! And the whole damn game is on ESPN :-)  <url>"
"<at>Dame_Lillard I feel you bro. I DID say the lyrics were definitely better. But I love the beat Shaq used and the smooth delivery. But I hear ya! Jalen Ike it down this morning on <at>First Take"
"I'm gonna give <at>Dloading the benefit of the doubt! <url>"
"Oh, Hell Yes! <url>e to the pros, <at>Zionwilliamson . Ecstatic that you’re here. Now, know this...... <url>"
"This right here is what it’s all about: reaching back, extending a helping hand to those less fortunate than ourselves. And the fact that HBCU’s were smack dab in middle of whole process made it even better. Thank you all. My team & I could not have pulled this off without you! <url>"
"What is going on in this work....especially on “<at>GetUpESPN this AM? <at>Espngreeny has every single person up there with blazers on — no tie — with everyone of them looking like they’re trying to audition for <at>Chippendales. Even <at>LRiddickESPN. What is up, fellas? #Haaaaaaa!!!!"
"Should college athletes get paid? I discussed with <at>MadisonSiriusXM.  <url>"
"How about THEM COWBOYS?!?!?! <url>"
"Hell Yes. I remember <url>"
"Sorry <at>Cowboys’ fans. I’m know you’re hurting this morning. So I just wanted to take a few minutes to try and make ya feel better, ya hear?😀#Haaaaaaaa <url>"
"Lord Have Mercy. Zion might not even make it to the playoffs and still.........I can’t wait for this <url>ing NBA Season! Might be the best season in 25 years! <url>"
"I absolutely, positively loveeeeeed this (via <at>thecheckdown). Mayfield started this at Ohio State. This was payback. All in fun. <url>petition ppl. Suck it up <url>"
"I’ve said it many times and I’ll say it again: if Ben Simmons develops a jump shot, the <at>76ers will win the NBA Title <url>"
"This is one of the most embarrassing performances I’ve seen in MLB postseason history. The <at>Braves are getting blitzed 9-0....IN THE TOP OF THE 1ST INNING. <at>Braves’ pitchers can’t get anyone out. Can’t throw strikes, either. ATL hasn’t been up to bat yet"
"I think Zion's rookie year will be very similar to SHAQ's! <url>"
"<at>SportsCenter You mean like this? 😀😀😀 #SCtop10 <url>"
"Friday mood <url>"
"DABO, your impersonation of me was perfect 😀 <url>"
"I've said this before. Jay-Z is ONE in a billion. But YOU CAN be Stephen A. Smith! <url>"

"You can watch the full <at>RapRadar interview here: <url>"
"Clemson demanded an apology. Well, they got it dammit! Y'all satisfied? <url>"
"I chatted with <at>patrickbetdavid about my career path and lots more! Watch it here: <url>"
"This is some straight BS. How many penalties are the <at>nyjets gonna get called against them? The officials are doing all they can to GIVE this game to the <at>dallascowboys. I swear!"
"J-E-T-S! JETS JETS JETS! <url>"
"Aaaahhhhhhhhhh! Go’ Head bro. Way to handle your business, dawg!!!!!!!! Proud of ya. Keep grinding. And btw....my Birthday is tomorrow...so thanks for the early Birthday present. <url>"
"I reckon you Cowboy fans are struggling! <url>"
"Major.....Major Thanks for the birthday wishes!!!! <url>"
"I reckon this brotha <at>mspears96 could use a hug. 🤠 <url>"
"That kind of day <url>"
"Obviously I'm having a very good day <url>"
"How bad do you want it? <url>"
"My condolences to <at>RealDealBeal23. <url>"
"I think the Pelicans should be very very concerned about Zion's injury. <url>"
"The great <at>RobertIger joined my show to talk about his newest book, ""The Ride of a Lifetime."" <url>"
"I asked <at>RobertIger if it's important to be the smartest guy in the room. <url>"
"That called 3rd strike just now vs the <at>Yankees Brett Gardner was straight B.S. that was not a damn strike. I know the <at>astros are the better team and it’s gonna take a miracle to win this, but damn......they don’t need more help like shit.#BullS&$<at>"
"F&$<at>!!!!!’ Told y’all...I never believed in Alroldis Chapman. What in the HELL are you getting cute for, throwing back-to-back 84 mph sliders? For what????? They can’t hit his gas. Chapman got cute, period. Horrible pitching selection. Over in 6...just like I knew it would be."
"Yes yes I gotta give credit to the damn <at>dallascowboys today! <url>"
"This is what I’ve been waiting for. <url>"
"Love this picture: <url>"
"Another day, another nauseating Cowboys fan calling into my show. <url>"
"First of all, the <at>nyjets are awful. Secondly, Sam Darnold has never looked worse. Third, Adam Gaseous is worse than the rest of the team. He’s gonna get <at>LeVeonBell killed with his play-calling. He was never the right man for the job. Damn shame <at>nyjets are on National TV."
"Why in the hell is Sam Darnold still in this game??? For what Adam Gase? Makes no sense. But then again, it does. It’s the <at>nyjets we’re talking about."
"Hey. I don’t give a damn if the <at>Bengals go 0-16. All that means to me is that they didn’t pick the right man to REPLACE Marvin Lewis. It does not mean Marvin Lewis did not deserve to go! <url>"
"Finally! Finally! Finally!!!!!!! <url>"
"NBA is back!!!!!!"
"I've been covering the NBA for 25 years. I've NEVER been more excited for a season. <url>"
"I’ll believe it when I see it. <url>"
"My NBA MVP prediction is in... <url>"
"Oooohhhhhhh, somebody on <at>GetUpESPN is in a WORLD of trouble, bringing up my hairline. Okay, Ryan Clarke. Okay😀😀😀"
"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! My NBA Show debuts TONIGHT. It’s Time!!!!!!! <url>"
"I was just emotional this morning on <at>FirstTake. Wha DDA ya want me to say: <url>"
"I’m about to appear on “THE JUMP” with <at>Rachel__Nichols right now. Buckle up!!!!"
"Here <url>e!!! 7pm <at>SportsCenter <url>"

"Thank you <url>"
"Yessir <url>"
"Thank you bro <url>"
"Thank you bro. Really appreciate it <url>"
"No sir. It’s just me hosting....for now. They were my debut guest. You’ll see me next week <url>"

"He’s getting there........maybe <url>"
"Here ya go bro <url>"
"Thank you bro <url>"
"If he plays, this isn’t even a contest: <url>"
"On my radio show, <at>DaTrillStak5 said <at>KingJames doesn't have that DOG mentality. <url>"
"Okay <at>nyknicks. Okay. I see y’all. Erased a 19-pt deficit. Wayne Ellington drilling 3-straight 3’s. Okay! Okay! I’m loving this. Forcing 25 TO’s by the <at>BrooklynNets so far, too. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
"There he is again. Kyrie Irving.....to the right wing....step back 3 with :21 left to give <at>BrooklynNets the lead. Damn!"
"Me and <at>KDTrey5 on the <at>boardroom this Wednesday on ESPN+! <url>"
"Answer the DAMN question! <url>"
"Y'all AINT gonna wanna MISS this! 😀<at>boardroom. It’s about that time. Released tomorrow....on ESPN+ <url>"
"I talked sources with <at>KDTrey5 on the <at>boardroom, NOW streaming on ESPN+! <url> <url>"
"YES, I STOOD by <url>ments calling it the WEAKEST move ever by a superstar! <url> <url>"
"Yeah! Yeah! It’s Wednesday, so you know what that means: <at>SportsCenter with Stephen A. Smith on ESPN at 7pm. It’s about that time 😀 <url>"
"Yessir the 2nd edition of <at>SportsCenter with Stephen A. Smith <url>ing up at 7pm!!! <url>"
"That’s the <url>ment of the day. Pierce and I defended <at>KyrieIrving. What the hell were you listening to?? <url>"
"Because you’re too busy paying attention to me than so many other obnoxious folks on TV. So you wouldn’t know any better <url>"
"Thank you so much <url>"
"Tell me about it <url>"
"Damn Right! Momma DURANT is no joke. I ain’t no fool :-) <url>"
"<at>celtics <url>"
"Not looking for anybody to get hurt. Certainly ain’t looking forward to two stars getting suspended. But love <url>bativeness. Can’t tell y’all how sick & tired I am of love affairs taking place on the court all the damn time. Give me <at>russwest44 attitude any day of the week... <url>"
"... we’ll get <url>petition that way."
"Congrats to the <at>Nationals. Cardiac kids — even if they’re one of the older teams in baseball. Soto is something special. And now that I’ve gotten that out the way, Hinch blew the damn game. You don’t have Greinke pitching that way and replace him with anyone but Gerrit Cole."
"No matter how Good Will Harris has been for the <at>astros in the postseason, you must go to Gerrit Cole — your damn Ace. You saw the <at>Nationals go to Corbin, right? That’s what you do. Hinch overthought a lot in Game 7. And it cost the <at>astros a title."
"It’s about to happen. <at>KDTrey5 on <at>FirstTake! <url>"
"Kevin Durant said the incident with <at>Money23Green played a part in him leaving Golden State. <url>"
"My Brother, CONGRATS big boy! Proud of you. Proud of the growth. You’ll shine at this the way you shine at everything you do. Forever your brother-from-another-mother. Keep doing it! <url>"
"You want to know something about <at>KyrieIrving, how about this: <url>"
"I always need to get the <at>GetUpESPN crew in order. <url>"
"I'll never forget this insight Denzel Washington gave me years ago. <url>"
"Are any of us <at>Knicks’ fans really surprised by this??? <url>"
"The GOAT just called me the GOAT. I’m getting emotional right now about this. <url>"
"Adam Gase is a waste of time and he should be fired. <url>"
"He <at>notthefakeSVP, I’m watching you on <at>SportsCenter right now. Don’t let <at>ESPNBooger and <at>Realrclark25 to get their hopes up. LSU will fall this weekend. #RollllllllllTIDE!!!!!"
"Sometimes, it’s hard to take this man😀 <url>"
"Yes, I UNLEASHED that black cat! I did it, damnit😀 <url>"
"Btw........no I did not forget to say Happy Birthday to my brother! <url>"
"Y'all know what time it is. <url>"
"Anthony Davis leaving the Lakers? PLEASE! <url>"
"Awwwww Damn!:-) <url>"
"Yeah, Yeah, <at>Realrclark25. I see you screaming on <at>GetUpESPN. You go ahead and do that. It won’t prevent your kittens — I mean “Tigers” — from taking this “L.” You better pray someone kidnaps Tua. If not YOU, SWAGU and <at>LSUfootball are going DOWN. You like the rhyme,😉.#RollTide!"
"LEBRON is just getting STARTED. <url>"
"Introducing my new segment... NO YOU DIDN’T! <url>"
"To my sisters <at>Chiney321 and Ros Gold-Onwude, to my brother <at>RealJayWilliams, fantastic job just now on <at>FirstTake interviewing <at>TheTraeYoung. See....it’s moments like this that brings a tear to this middle-aged man. Look at y’all making me proud, filling in this way.#😉👍😉✌️😅"
"Just when I was about to spread more love on <at>FirstTake  to my brothers, Dominique Foxworth and <at>damienwoody, this damn man Woody is sitting in my seat without a TIE. Man.....don’t make <url>e through this screen and deal with you. And before you open your mouth, watch ur tone!"
"I tell people all the time... EVERYBODY has to answer to somebody. <url>"
"Here we go again on <at>GetUpESPN. The whole crew, led by <at>Espngreeny and <at>LRiddickESPN looking like they’re auditioning for <at>Chippendales. Y’all are something! Haaaaa"
"How y’all let the Cowboys <url>e “AMERICA’S TEAM” ??? <url>"
"I said it years ago. I say it now. I will forever say this: <url>"
"I agree with the Clippers being fined and here’s why. <url>"
"It’s official. The <at>NCAA is a damn travesty. This kid Wiseman is ineligible — after already starting the season — because COACH Penny Hardaway is a booster? This is straight B.S. no wonder <at>KingJames and so many others are so against the NCAA. Hey <at>NBA, I’ve got an idea:"
"Go ahead afterall and add a 3rd round in the <at>NBA draft. Just make sure to create a route where kids can finish their education, plus have an insurance policy for potential injuries. Enough with the <at>NCAA. They just need to go. They make me so sick. Why’d the kid start the season"
"To my boys <at>SECNetwork: <at>TimTebow, <at>finebaum and <at>mspears96: ROLLLL TIDDDDEEE!!!!!! <url>"
"What in the Hell is going on with <at>AlabamaFTBL right now??? First, a fumble by Tua, messing up a TD. Then a muffed punt. Now an INT called back because of 12-men on the field. Who is this team right now????#Damn!!!!"
"This is the 3rd blitz we’ve seen from <at>LSUfootball where the defender was not even TOUCHED by <at>AlabamaFTBL’s offensive line.....having clear shots at Tua. This is not looking good, Damnit!!!"
"I’m done. I’m giving it up to <at>mspears96, <at>Realrclark25 and <at>ESPNBooger. What I’m seeing from <at>LSUfootball is an ass whupping in <at>AlabamaFTBL. Bama can’t stop them and, offensively, Tua & the boys ain’t doing anything. Too many mistakes, too. Just awful, just like Nat’l title GM."
"Add dropped touchdown passes to the lost of <at>AlabamaFTBL mistakes. That was a perfect throw to Jeudy and he flat-out dropped it.#IAmDepressed!"
"The <at>LSUfootball Tigers went into Tuscaloosa and dropped 40!!! I can’t say a damn word. Because I did not see <url>ing!"
"About damn time Jeudy. That was the 2nd TD pass you dropped, fore making up for it by catching that one. NOW <at>AlabamaFTBL..whatcha gonna do. Can you get 1-damn-stop and get Tua the ball back with enough time left? Can you do it? It’s time, damnit!"
"I don’t even know who this <at>AlabamaFTBL team is. Could not get a single stop that mattered all game long. <at>LSUfootball rolled into TUSCALOOSA and nearly dropped 50 on the Tide. Embarrassing performance by Bama’s D! Props to the Tigers. Can’t say a word!"
"I’m now going to be taking fan submissions for this segment. Please tweet me with #NoYouDidnt and I will include the best ones in my show!! 😀"
"If there was ever a time where I wish I WASN'T restricted by FCC airwaves, it would be RIGHT NOW, DAMNIT! <url>"
"Look Barry White — I mean <at>mspears96 — if you want people to <at>GetUpESPN, especially if you’re gonna be ready for ME.....you’d better get your energy up. Just because your <at>LSUfootball got LUCKY, doesn’t mean you get to recline and chill w/ Mr. <at>Chippendales, I mean <at>Espngreeny:-)"
"Disney+ has arrived, y'all. The best way to find it is by downloading the Disney Plus App or going to <url> I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.#LookOutWorld!!! <url>"
"Some more information on Kaepernick's workout... <url>"
"Make sure to tune into my sit down with <at>JHarden13 during my SportsCenter Special ahead of Clippers vs. Rockets tonight. <url>"
"When we think about <at>Astros, we use to think about their greatness being contaminated by them having an abuser on their squad. Now, we can add cheating to the list. Damn! <url>"
"I think it's likely that Colin Kaepernick gets a job in the NFL following his private workout. Assuming........ <url>"
"He’s the No.2-overall pick in the draft for a reason <url>"
"Now THIS is totally hilarious. What betrayal on the part of Austin Rivers. And I love it! <url>"
"This week’s edition of #NoYouDidnt!!! <url>"
"I’m sorry, but can this guy Mason Rudolph at least PRETEND he sees the rush? I mean, these are not blind-side blitz’s the <at>Browns are throwing at him. He’s acting like he can’t freakin move out the way.#Damn!"
"Go to <at>MylesLGarrett page and you’ll see the headline: “A Hero is made by the path he chooses, not by the power he is graced with.” Yet, he goes and does what he did to Mason Rudolph. This calls for an automatic SEASON-ENDING SUSPENSION. He should be DONE for the rest of the year"
"And btw....neither Pouncey nor DiCastro should be suspended AT ALL. All they did was protect a defenseless teammate — who happened to be their damn QUARTERBACK. They shouldn’t be penalized at all."
"“Indefinite” attached to a suspension with the NFL means something, folks: that there’s more <url>e. <url>"
"He doesn't want to play. <url>"
"<at>E_Reid35 Man, please. You embarrass yourself <at>E_Reid35 every single time you open your mouth. You — of all people — talking of tap dancing when you’re the one collecting a check from the very institution you collect a check from. You <at>E_Reid35, who takes a knee — supposedlyfor brothers —"
"<at>E_Reid35 Yet attack brothers — Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z, ME — at every turn the second someone disagrees with you. You <at>E_Reid35 got the nerve to call out the <at>NFL when your beef was suppose to be with society in regards to police brutality and racial oppression. Where’s your plan?"
"<at>E_Reid35 Huh <at>E_Reid35? To call our or beat up everyone who utters a word you disagree with? All Brithers, BTW. Let me tell you something Mr. <at>E_Reid35: Kaepernick has been supported. We’ve all said he was done wrong. That he was blackballed. That he should be in the league. Who the hell"
"<at>E_Reid35 Hasn’t acknowledged that? But life isn’t fair. It damn sure ain’t ideal. And at some point, you’ve got the grab the opportunity. Kap’s occurred today. And what does he do: alters the process, and shows up with a T-Shirt alluding to SLAVERY <at>E_Reid35. For a JOB INTERVIEW! When"
"<at>E_Reid35 are you — yes, you <at>E_Reid35 — going to wake the hell up and realize that maybe, just maybe, the enemy at THIS POINT ain’t the NFL. It’s not Malcolm Jenkins, Jay-Z or ME. Maybe the enemy is YOU, your childish tendencies and your unwillingness to accept that you can’t run......."
"<at>E_Reid35 a damn thing but so much when your hand is out for someone else’s dime or product. Especially when you haven’t played in 3 years, when you were 1-10 in your last 11 games as a starter and the top-4 league MVP candidates are all black <at>E_Reid35. When will you learn?"
"<at>E_Reid35 Chances are.....you won’t. Because your ears are clogged and you’re too blinded by vitriol to see when a brother is showing you — y’all — love and respect <at>E_Reid35 by simply letting you know what will work at what won’t. But oh, I forgot: we all ain’t S&<at>$ in your world. So..."
"<at>E_Reid35 why even bother. You’ll never listen. But others will hear <at>E_Reid35. You can bet the house on that. Just listen. <url>ing from the multitude of places. And it’s damn sure — like a storm — on <at>FirstTake Monday morning. So buckle the hell up!
Good luck on Sunday. Sincerely!"
"Excuse the couple of spelling errors. I was driving before pulling off the road"
"<at>E_Reid35 ... The more you talk, the more ridiculous you sound, <at>E_Reid35: <url>"
"The fact that Colin Kaepernick didn't show up to his original workout location eradicates his points altogether. <url>"
"This is what needs to be said about the Kaepernick situation. <url>"
"Listen to this, Damnit! <url>"
"I went on <at>karenhunter’s show to discuss whether or not Colin Kaepernick really wants to play. Watch the full damn thing here! <url>"
"Hey, <at>KingJames is still the Greatest — TODAY! But let me be clear: I'll never take LeBron over MJ and here's why. <url>"
"You know what time it is!!! <at>SportsCenter with Stephen A starts at 7pm EST. DON’T MISS IT! <url>"
